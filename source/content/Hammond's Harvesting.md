## Chapter 1: Introduction

_Welcome dear reader to Hamund’s Harvesting Handbook,
written by none other than I, Hamund Holderhek! But who
am I you ask? Well, I am an adventurer at heart, a writer by_

_passion, and a harvester at trade. I have travelled the many
planes of the multiverse in search of adventure and story
(for more of those stories, pick up any copy of “Hamund’s
Harrowing Histories I-XXXV”)._

_Through my life I have fought and defeated just about
every kind of creature you can imagine: I have tussled with
treants, skirmished with sphinxes, and even engaged in_

_fisticuffs with a fomorian or two. Never being one to let
something go to waste, I always took my trusty hunting
knife to these creatures and had a look to see what they
had to offer. I have spent many years writing down my_

_findings and anecdotes, and I now present them to you less
seasoned adventurers so you may soak in my wisdom._

```
Yes, what you hold in your hands right now is a helpful
```
_guide to harvesting the creatures that a typical adventurer
may face. You’ll learn not just how valuable a roc’s guts are,
but also which way to twist your knife in order to extract
them. The natural world is filled with riches just waiting for_

_bold people like us to take them!_

```
Good luck and good harvesting,
```
```
-Sir Hamund Holderhek, O.B.H. (First Class), V.A., N.K.P.
```
### Aim of this Guide

Let’s be honest, every Dungeon Master has faced this exact
problem at least once: their players have just finished

killing a fearsome monster, and their first reaction is to
slice it apart for loot. Now there’s nothing wrong with this
of course, but it can be a bit harrowing for a DM to not just
come up with useful monster parts on the spot, but to also

provide an interesting description, a monetary value, and a
use for that part.

```
This book aims to act as a handy reference for the DM’s
```
that find themselves in this very situation. It provides a loot
table for every single unique monster in the 5th Edition
_Monster Manual_. These loot tables are easy to reference
and contain every piece of information your players could

need when they tear their fresh kills apart. It also
possesses over 200 new and unique craftable items to be
made from your harvesting adventures, and all the
information you would need for them. There are of course

rules for both the harvesting and the crafting, and a few
extra goodies strewn in here too.

```
Everything has been written with balance in mind, but
```
you are of course free to rebalance anything in this guide to
suit your own table, or feel free to message me at
driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com or hit me up on Twitter
@drifterworkshop to discuss anything in this guide.

Also check out for Volume 2 of Hamund's Harvesting
Handbook, already released on the DM's Guild! It covers
the monsters of Volo's Guide to Monsters, along with
several new features like spells and a quest board.


## Chapter 2: How to Harvest

The act of removing useful body parts from a
creature is referred to as _harvesting_.
Anything that can be harvested from a
creature is referred to as a _harvesting
material_ or simply _material_. In general, only
creatures that have died may be harvested,
but there may be some exceptions based on
context.

This section details the steps associated with actually
performing a harvest, and any factors that may influence it.

### Appraising

_“My mother always used to press the importance of taking
one’s time and not jumping into things. This advice holds
true whether one is harvesting a creature, engaging in a
fight, or literally jumping into a river.”_ –

Hamund

Before a player begins hacking and butchering their hunt,
they may instead choose to take a moment first and

_appraise_ the creature to be harvested. To do this, they must
spend 1 minute examining the creature to be harvested
and then roll an Intelligence check, adding their proficiency
bonus if they are proficient in the skill corresponding to

that creature (see table below). For example, appraising a
Beholder (which is an aberrant), the check would be an
Intelligence (Arcana) check, while appraising an Ogre
(which is a giant) would require an Intelligence (Medicine)
check.

The DC of the check is equal to **8 + the Harvested
Creature’s CR** (treating any CR less than 1 as 0). Success
on this check grants the player full knowledge of any useful
harvesting materials on the creature, the DC requirement

to harvest those materials, any special requirements to
harvest them, and any potential risks in doing so. In
addition, any harvesting check made on that creature by
that player is rolled at advantage. A character may only

attempt one appraisal check per creature.

#### Splitting up the responsibilities

```
Some party members may prefer to let one character
handle the appraisal of materials, while another more
dextrous character handles the actual harvesting. In this
scenario, all benefits of appraising a creature are conferred
to the player doing the harvesting, so long as the player that
performed the appraising assists the harvesting player
through the whole duration of the harvest.
```
### Harvesting

```
In order to harvest a creature, a character must make a
Dexterity ability check using the same skill proficiency as
listed in the above appraising table. For example, a
character attempting a harvest check on an Aberrant would
receive a bonus equal to their Dexterity modifier and their
proficiency in Arcana (if they have any).
This check reflects a character’s ability to not only
properly remove the intended item without damaging it, it
also involves any ancillary requirements of the harvest such
as proper preservation and storage techniques.
```
###### Using other proficiencies

```
If a player is harvesting a certain creature, or harvesting a
creature of a certain type of material, the DM may allow
them to use a relevant tool proficiency rather than a skill
proficiency.
For example, the DM may allow a player to add their
proficiency with Tinker’s Tools to their attempt to harvest a
mechanical golem or use their proficiency with
leatherworking tools when attempting to harvest a creature
for its hide. Alternatively, all creature type proficiencies may
be replaced by proficiency with the harvesting kit.
```
```
Each individual item in a creature’s harvesting table is
listed with a DC next to it. Any roll that a player makes that
equals or exceeds this DC grants that player that item.
Rewards are cumulative, and a player receives every item
with a DC equal to or below their ability check result. For
example, rolling a total of 15 on a check to harvest an azer
will reward the player with both “azer ash’, and “azer
bronze skin”, but not a “spark of creation”. If they so wish,
players may opt to not harvest a material even if they have
met the DC threshold to harvest it.
Only one harvesting attempt may be made on a creature.
Failure to meet a certain item’s DC threshold assumes that
the item was made unsalvageable due to the harvester’s
incompetence.
For most creatures, the time it takes to harvest a
material is counted in minutes and is equal to the DC of
that material divided by 5. For huge creatures however, it is
equal in DC of that material, while for gargantuan
creatures, it is equal to the DC of that material multiplied
by 2.
```

#### Particularly violent deaths

" _I know that it is a dangerous world out there, and we all
must do what we can to survive. But do understand that
there are few people out there that are in the market for a
charred owlbear pelt with more holes in it than the plot of a
bad novel."_                                                                    - Hamund

This guide assumes that most creatures you attempt to
harvest died in direct combat and thus already accounts for
the idea that you are harvesting creatures that are not in

pristine condition. However, some deaths are more violent
than others and can make harvesting useful materials
either extremely difficult or downright impossible. Such
examples include burning by fire, dissolving from acid, or

being completely crushed under a pillar of stone. In these
cases, raise the DC for harvesting any of that creature’s
materials by 5. Alternatively, the DM may decide that well-
orchestrated hunts result in a carcass that is prime for

harvesting, such as creatures killed mostly through psychic
damage, or those killed in one clean attack. In these cases,
the DM should lower the DC for harvesting any of that
creature’s materials by 5.

Furthermore, the DM may adjudicate whether or not
some of a creature’s individual materials have been made
useless due to effects imposed by them in the course of
their death. Examples may include blood being tainted

from poisoning, or their pelt being worthless due to
excessive slashing/piercing damage.

###### Optional Rule: Carcass

###### Degradation

```
This guide mostly assumes that harvesting takes
place on a freshly killed corpse and that little to
no decomposition has yet occurred. However, in
some cases, a player may desire to harvest a
creature that has been dead for quite a while. In
these cases, the DM may declare that certain
body parts have already withered away and
become unharvestable or may decide to increase
the DC’s of all harvestable materials as if the
creature had died a particularly violent death. If
corpse decomposition is too advanced, it is
entirely within the DM’s right to deny harvesting
the creature altogether.
```
```
As a quick guide, the following timeline may be
observed to decide on decomposition levels:
```
```
1 hour after death: The carcass’ hide has
ruptured from bloating and has become
useless.
1 day after death: The carcass’ blood has
become too tainted to be useful, and soft
tissues like the eyes have putrefied.
3 days after death: The carcass’ internal organs
have decomposed
7 days after death: The carcass has undergone
extensive putrefaction and none of its soft
tissue remains harvestable.
Note: Harder materials like bones, teeth,
claws, and hair do not generally undergo
decomposition and will remain usable
indefinitely.
```

## Chapter 3: The Harvest Tables

# A

_fter countless autopsies, vivisections,
experiments, and just plain butchering, I have
amassed what is most likely the most
complete set of knowledge regarding the
anatomies, uses, and values of the wondrous
creatures that inhabit our worlds. I now
present this knowledge (as well as some
rather choice anecdotes) to you, dear reader._

                                  -Hamund

### Understanding the Tables

Every unique monster from the _Monster Manual_ has been

listed in this book with an associated harvest table. When
your players attempt a harvest, simply look up the relevant
monster in this guide and read out the results (monsters
are listed in the same order as in the _Monster Manual_ ). The

following is an explanation of how to read the table.

#### DC

This is the DC required to harvest this item. Any harvesting

check that equals or exceeds this threshold allows the
player that made that check to succsessfully harvest that
item.

#### Item

The name of the item received. While for most items, the
player only receives one of the listed item, some item
names have parentheses next to them. These indicate the
amount that a player receives upon a successful harvest
e.g.: Aarakocra Feather (small pouch) or Aboleth Mucus (

vials). At the DM’s discretion however, they may adjudicate
that a player receives less or more than the stipulated
quantity. Such reasons may include extremely high success
on a roll, or certain methods in which the creature was

killed.

###### Optional Rule: Harvesting

###### Dangerous Materials

```
Harvesting some creatures are more dangerous
than others. While most creatures are harmless
once killed, others possess poisons, acids, and
breath sacks that remain active even after the
creature’s death. Even worse is that a simple
misplaced knife stroke or errant twitch of the
hand can lead to these materials accidentally
harming the harvester.
```
```
Under this optional rule, whenever a harvester
rolls below the DC of a harvestable material that
has a “Use” section that deals damage, the
material is not just lost, it also expends its ability
on the harvester. For example, a character that
fails to properly harvest a poison would suffer
the effect of that poison on themselves, or a
character that fails to harvest a breath sack would
release the effect of that breath sack in their
direction. The exact adjudication of the failure
result may change depending on the DM.
```
#### Description

```
A brief description of the item to be harvested, written by
Hamund. While this is usually just for flavour, some items
also have a “ Use ” section. These items may be used
immediately after being harvested and require no further
adjustments or crafting. Their function is described here in
the description box.
Additionally, some materials have harvesting
requirements beyond just steady hands and a sharp knife.
Any extra requirements or criteria for harvesting a material
will be listed here.
```
#### Value

```
All materials are listed with their base resell value. This is
how much money an average shopkeeper would be willing
to pay for the materials in good conditions. DM discretion
is advised when varying this value, dependant on
shopkeeper mood, rarity within the setting, condition of the
material, etc. A material with a value listed as “varies”
indicates that its usage is too specific for it to be sold to an
average shopkeeper, and the value of the material would
depend heavily on context.
When items are harvested in discrete quantities, the
value listed refers to each individual item. For example,
Aboleth Mucus is harvested as a set of 3 vials, and so the
value listed (20 gp) refers to each individual vial (so
successfully harvesting Aboleth Mucus would be worth 3 x
20 gp = 60 gp). When items are listed as indiscrete
quantities however, the value listed refers to the entire
quantity. For example, Aarakocra Feathers are harvested in
the indiscrete quantity of a: “small pouch.” Thus the 8 sp
value listed refers to the value of a “small pouch of
Aarakocra Feathers,” not 8 sp for each individual feather.
```
###### Value Factors

```
The values listed here are based on a myriad of factors
including: CR of the monster, average treasure horde values,
use in crafting, whether the monster tends to be found
alone, whether the item is consumable, probability of
successfully harvesting the item, balance around existing
prices, and sometimes just for flavour. These prices are
intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust
these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is
also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have
high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For
example, although a Death Knight Heart may be worth the
high price of 4,000 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the
village grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an
esoteric item can be an entertaining side quest in and of
itself, or simply used as a good downtime activity.
```

#### Weight

The weight of the item listed in pounds. The weight listed
here follows the same rules as values do; the listed number
refers to the weight of individual items, unless that item is
harvested in indistinct quantities, in which case the weight
refers to the whole indistinct quantity.

#### Crafting

Some items, although valuable, require a skilled artisan to
craft them into a usable item. The material’s description

details which item they can be crafted into. If this section is
blank, the item has no craftable item associated with it.
The section of crafted items at the end of this book
details the usage of crafted items, as well as details on their

crafting requirements. Some craftable items originate from
published source books from WotC. These receive special
tags in brackets that denote which book they come from.
**For more information on crafting visit Chapter 4.**

### Humanoid Trinket Tables

```
“In general, humanoids do not yield much in the way of
harvestable materials. Partly this is just the negative
relationship that humanoid evolution has with innate
magical abilities, but mostly it’s just because polite society
frowns upon butchering things that look vaguely like
themselves.”
-Hamund
```
```
Most humanoids listed in this book do not possess many
useful materials to harvest. In order to complement the
relatively bare tables of humanoids, a separate table is
listed in their section describing items that may be
plundered off of these creatures. These items tend to be
random trinkets and are not weapons or armour. More
often than not, they are relatively useless and are intended
only to be used for resale.
There is no ability check required to pilfer these trinkets,
and the DM is free to decide which of these trinkets can be
found on a typical corpse (if any at all). These tables are
intended to be largely used as DM inspiration and to sate
the lust of loot-hungry players while avoiding the ghoulish
activity of dismembering a humanoid corpse.
Like all harvested items, the value and weight listed
refers to 1 unit of the respective item in that row.
```

## Harvest Table: A

### Aarakocra

_“Aarakocra are an interesting folk. As stoic and flighty as the birds they resemble, they nevertheless make good company when
coaxed down from their solitary perches. Interesting as well is that despite being very magical themselves, their wings are
relatively useless for any sort of crafting. Perhaps the Wind Dukes of Aaqa realised that having servants everyone would want
to hunt would be a bad idea.”_ - Hamund

```
The large feathers of an aarakocra are enjoyed among some of the more
ostentatious members of society as fun accessories and fashion highlights. If you
can find a tailor willing to take them, you are sure to be able to earn at least a few
silver for a good amount of them.
```
```
8sp 2 lb.

```
10 Aarakocra
Heart

```
Aarakocra have an innate connection to the elemental planes that allows them to
summon air elementals when enough of them gather together. Burning their hearts
in an offering can achieve much of the same effect but with less control over the
temperment of the summoned elemental.
Use: When 5 different creatures within 30 feet of each other hold 5 different
aarakocra hearts and spend their actions on three consecutive turns to burn the
hearts, they may summon an air elemental in an unoccupied space within 60 feet
of them. The burners must remain still while burning the hearts. This elemental is
hostile to all creatures it can see around it, but any of the 5 creatures that
summoned it can spend their action to try and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma
(Persuasion) check to direct the air elemental's hostility at a creature they can both
see within 60 feet. The air elemental remains for 1 hour.

### Angels

_“I have never claimed to be a saint myself, and in my pursuit of rare game and hunts I will admit that I have drawn the ire of
more than one angel. While tussling with an angel is a risky proposition, harvesting one is even worse as it comes with the risk
of ticking off their celestial patron. But then again, if you’ve gone far enough down the dark path to kill an angel, you’ve
probably already committed yourself to being on the wrong side of a god’s attention.”_ - Hamund

While an angel’s parts may be useful, harvesting a good-aligned angel is considered a universally evil act. Most good-aligned
gods will condemn any character that perpetuates such a thing, even if the angel being harvested was not theirs. As such, any
character attempting to harvest or attune to an item made from an angel that is still in service to a good-aligned god has a 30

per cent chance of being inflicted with the _curse of the fallen_.

While inflicted with the _curse of the fallen,_ a creature becomes vulnerable to radiant damage and any magical healing that
comes from a good-aligned cleric or paladin automatically fails when used on the cursed character. This curse can only be

removed if the cursed character spends 24 hours in a vigil at a temple of the god of the angel who they attempted to harvest or
whose part they attempted to attune to. After these 24 hours, a follower of that god may then cast the spell _remove curse_ to
end the curse.

Blood
(

```
The blood of an angel flows with radiant energy that brings life to all it touches (it
clearly didn't work hard enough for its original owner though). Many of the most
desperate people actively seek angels in an attempt to harvest their blood as a
panacea, without putting much thought into the worse fate that awaits them should
they succeed.
Use: When you drink this blood, you regain 8d8+4 hit points and are freed from any
curse (except the curse of the fallen), disease, poison, blindness, and deafness.

There is perhaps nothing more distinctive than the sillhouette of glorious white
angel wings against a radiant light. As some of the most powerful magical wings in
all the planes, these make for almost perfect base materials for the ever-useful wings
of flying.

The burning gaze of a solar is capable of reducing even the strongest of evildoers to

extraordinarily powerful magic on them can transform them into diamonds that
shine the same way they did under the solar's control.

The basis of any animated object is the magical rune etched into its surface that
enchants it and brings it to life. While these runes cannot be transferred from one

The fibers of an enchanted rug continue to carry on a special property to them

DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
5 Ankheg
Chitin
```
```
Extremely hard, but too unwieldy and unconfortable to use in making armour. The
ankheg's hide still finds some uses as a building material, especially for subterranean
```
```
dwelllers who appreciate its suitability to rocky environments.
```
```
1 gp 30 lb.
```
```
10 Ankheg
Gaster
```
```
A series of bladders in the hindquarters of an ankheg, this organ is analagous to the
intestines of a humanoid. Although ankhegs are known for eating flesh, they absorb
the majority of their nutrients from the soil they burrow through. Artificers are able
to take this fact and create a handy survival tool for explorers with a strong stomach.
```
```
2 gp 9 lb. Canteen

```
```
15 Ankheg
Bile (
vials)
```
```
Ankhegs are well known for their incredibly potent digestive fluids that dissolve their
prey. As such, alchemists find ankheg bile to be a particularly useful ingredient when
creating their own acidic concoctions.
Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a target
within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against the target,
treating the vial as an improvised object. On a hit, the target suffers 1d6 acid
damage.

over their creations for good luck.
```
```
1 sp 1 lb.
```
```
15 Azer
Bronze
Skin
```
```
Azers need no armour, as their skin is already made of durable, mastercrafted
bronze. While the trauma of its owner's demise has made the skin difficult to
repurpose directly for armour, it is still high quality material, and any blacksmith
worth their salt would be happy to get it.

Although the azer of this particular flame of creation is dead, a single
smouldering spark remains, and those with knowledge of the arcane are able to
quickly harvest and store it safely for later use. While small, these sparks have
immense potential and are often used in either the construction of living
trinkets, or the lighting of magical forges. Requires enchanted vial.

15 Banshee
Echo
```
```
The incorporeal banshee leaves very little behind except the last whispers of its
terrible wail. With some spirit paper, a good harvester can collect the echo of this
wail before it vanishes forever and use it in times of desperation. Requires spirit
paper.
Use: You may spend an action to tear this item open and release the banshee wail
kept within. All creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear must make a DC 13
Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a
success, a creature takes 3d6 psychic damage. This wail has no effect on
constructs and undead.

As the basilisk feeds on stone, its teeth are infamous for being extraordinarily hard

```
```
2 gp 2 lb.
```
```
10 Basilisk
Eye (x2)
```
```
The petrifying gaze of the basilisk is known far and wide. As such, the eyes of a
basilisk are prized for their inherent magical properties and their use in the creation
of petrifying tonics. It is said that more nefarious wizards make use of these eyes to
create trapped statues that transform unwary intruders into stone.
```
```
2 gp 1 lb. Basilisk

Bile (

It is a common misconception that basilisks digest stone. In fact, the fluids inside the
basilisk's gullet transform consumed stone back into organic matter to be consumed.
This bile is thus worth a good amount to alchemists seeking to make an oil to
counter the effects of a basilisk's gaze.

```
```
10 Behir
Scales
(large
bag)
```
```
The scales of a behir resemble a dragon's but are different in many ways in the
eyes of a trained observer. While these scales are often found decorating items in
an unscrupulous tailor's shop marketed as actual dragon scales, the fact that they
are much smoother and more flexible than an actual dragon's makes them much
more useful for fashion.
```
```

```
```

15 Behir
Horn
```
```
The horn of a behir is composed of a unique keratin that has an odd reaction to
the presence of dragons. A dragon's mere presence causes these horns to
resonate, usually alerting a behir to the presence of their hated foe. The horns will
still function in the hands of anyone else, but the dragon usually must be much
closer for the vibrations to be detected.
Use: When within 1 mile of a dragon (whether it in its true form or polymorphed
into a different shape), this horn will begin to vibrate, with the vibrations
becoming more pronounced the closer it is to the dragon. This horn does not
indicate the direction of the dragon, only its general proximity.

This large, but surprisingly light leathery sack is located at the back of the behir's
cavernous mouth, and is roughly the size of a picnic basket. Inside is a mixture of
chemicals, fluids and enzymes that when exposed to the open air, erupts in a
destructive crackle of lightning. While extremely dangerous, alchemists and
weaponsmiths alike will crawl over themselves to obtain some of this powerful
energy.
Use: The lightning sack can be thrown by itself up to a range of 20 feet. If thrown,
the lightning sack will explode on impact, dealing 4d10 lightning damage to all
creatures in a 10 foot radius, or half that on a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving
throw.

### Beholders

_“Beholders are an odd bunch and difficult to define in terms of harvesting. This is because no two beholders are ever similar,
varying wildly in anatomy, colour, and appearance. Despite this, each one seems to think of themselves as being perfect in
form. It boggles the mind, but you know what they say about beauty.”_ -Hamund

##### Beholder

```
DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
15 Beholder
Membrum
```
```
The anatomy of a beholder is infinitely alien and strange to any scholar native to
the Material Plane. One of the most curious features of the beholder is that aside
from its brain, the beholder features a noticeable dearth of internal organs.
Instead, any internal space not occupied by brain matter is filled with a large
rubbery balloon that seems to act as the beholder's heart, lungs, and stomach.
How it achieves all of these simultaneous functions is unknown. This organ is as
versatile as its owner, and many scholars are eager to obtain a complete sample
for their research into transmutation.
```

20 Beholder
Eye Stalk

```
While the eye stalks of the beholder may be severed from its body, they still retain
some of the magical energy that allowed them to fire powerful rays at their
enemies. Skilled artificers can take these stalks and use them as the cores of
magical wands that emit the same types of rays they emitted in life. Alternatively,
four of the intact stalks may be used as part of a ritual to summon a spectator.
```
```
If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d10. The type of eye stalk they receive
corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the beholder statblock.

The main eye of the beholder is unique in that instead of issuing forth a beam of
magical energy, it instead does the opposite: emitting a cone of nullification that
disrupts the Weave and prevents the functioning of any magic it gazes at. While it
is inactive due to being severed from a living beholder, learned wizards know how
to transfigure this organ into an anti-magic crystal, the type that can be used to
protect their own strongholds against magical incursions.

Eye Stalk
```
```
The stalks of the spectator are less powerful than those of the beholder it
consumed to be summoned. However, their potential to be made into wands by
artificers are the same. When crafted properly, they continue to contain an arcane
charge that allows them to discharge the same types of magical rays they did in
life.

The main eye of the spectator functions differently to that of the beholder. While
the beholder's emits an anti-magic cone at all times, the spectator's can be used
to reflect poorly casted spells at other targets. When used for crafting, the magic
of the eye can be transferred over to a shield, to grant it the same ability.

Most blights are incapable of speech as we understand it. Instead, they communicate

allow the user to communicate with regular plant life.

The rapid ability of the blights to spread their influence is well known to any forest
dweller. They do this through the many seeds that each blight carries within them.
These dry, wrinkled seeds sprout in a matter of hours and grow to maturity in days,
forming the infamous vines, brambles, and weeds of a blight infestation. While most
of their dark properties are lost if not planted by an actual blight, some alchemists
are capable of repurposing them for a crop fertiliser or an oil that reacts strangely
with plantlife.

_“Bugbears, an annoying bunch and probably my least liked of all the goblinoid races. Their bodies yield little in terms of good

The most fearsome of bugbears carry with them the blessing of their god Hruggek
which allows them to surge past any danger and debilitations. If you are willing to
indulge in your own inner savage, you too can take this blessing by consuming the
bugbear's heart, but beware of any side effects.
Use: You may spend an action to consume this heart. If you do so, you have
advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned,
stunned, or put to sleep for the next hour. Once this effect wears off, you must
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion as
the adrenalinne filled organ passes through your system.

Unlike most fiends, a cambion does not dissolve when it is slain. Its bizarre

As their name implies, carrion crawlers feast solely on putrid and rotting flesh. As
disgusting as their digestive system may seem, it is uniquely adapted to overcoming
any diseases or poisoning that would befall any other creature attempting such a diet.
Local healers have thus developed numerous uses for a carrion crawler's guts, ranging
from a salve to treat gangrene, to a tonic for treating indigestion.

The mucus of a carrion crawler is remarkably poisonous, especially since it only
requires contact with the skin to take effect.
Use: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on itself on a success. A vial of this poison may be applied to coat 1 melee weapon or
up to 10 pieces of ammunition. These remain coated for 10 minutes after which the
poison degrades too much to be useful.

The leonine front paws of the chimera. Larger than a normal lion's, with claws twice
as sharp. Some druids prefer using these as their focus when performing
transmutation magic, believing that it makes their spellwork easier. Whether that is
true or not has yet to be confirmed.

The draconic wings of the chimera. While they lack the same amount of magical
power as a genuine dragon's wings, they are also much easier to handle and much
easier to get a hold of. Daring tinkers have taken to using them in making kites
strong enough to lift smaller races high into the air.

One of the chimera's three heads. While the flame is less powerful than a genuine
dragon's, the glands that produce the flame is much easier to access in a chimera's
head, and provide materials that are much more stable to work with. Alchemists
prize these glands as a source of highly flammable oil.

DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
10 Chuul
Pincer
(x2)
```
```
The oversized pincer of a monstrous chuul. While too unwieldy to be fashioned into
a useful weapon, the razor sharp hooks can be repurposed for useful tools, including,
but not limited to, instruments of torture.
```
```
3 gp 40 lb.
```
```
15 Chuul
Venom
(vial)
```
```
A rather nasty toxin, wringed from the tentacle appendages of the chuul.
Unfortunately, the death of its owner causes it to lose much of its potency but can
still be used as a base by knowledgable alchemists to create another paralysing
potion.
```
```

```
1 lb. Chuul's

```
```
20 Arcana
Ganglia
```
```
At the base of a chuul's brain lies a peculiar bundle of nerves referred to as the
arcana ganglia. This highly sensitive lobe vibrates in the presence of magic and is
what grants chuul's their innate ability to sense magic around them. Designed by
their aboleth masters through generations of magic and breeding, there are only a
handful of artificers in the world capable of repurposing it into a functioning tool
capable of replicating the chuul's natural ability.

Tooth
(small

```
Resembling the needle-like teeth of a moray eel but stronger, the teeth of the
cloaker can be used to make a variety of tools. Some of the more notorious
thieves in the world even boast possessing lockpick sets made entirely of
cloaker teeth.
```
```
5 gp 2 lb.
```
```
15 Cloaker
Tail

The infamous cloaker tail, covered in dozens of razor sharp spines. Drow
taskmasters have developed a technique of taking the tails, treating them with
special oils, and reusing them as whips.

```
20 lb. Whip +

```
20 Cloaker
Hide
```
```
Even for the most experienced of tanners, the skin of the cloaker is
exceptionally difficult to remove. Due to the cloaker's unique physiology, a
single misplaced cut can cause the creature's internal enzymes to spill and stain
the hide. If done correctly however, the skin will maintain its shadowy and
illusive appearance and may be used as the foundation for the ever useful cloak
of displacement.

### Cockatrice

```
DC Item Description ValueWeight Crafting
```
```
10 Cockatrice
Bile (vial)
```
```
Unlike basilisks, a cockatrice cannot consume stone. Unfortunately, anything that
receives so much as a graze from its beak becomes petrified, and with the
cockatrice's frenzied hunting style, such an occurrence is more then common.
As such, its bile has certain properties that slow down the petrification process,
allowing the cockatrice to get some nourishment before its food becomes
undigestible. This bile has become a staple of a stonemason's toolkit as it allows
them to temporarily soften stone for easier handling.
```
```
2 sp 1 lb.
```
```
15 Cockatrice
Droppings
(small
pouch)
```
```
Cockatrices are infamous for their enthusiasm in devouring a meal, and as such,
they occasionally end up swallowing food that they have already accidentally
petrified. The food remains stone through the cockatrice's digestive system, and
some consider the resulting food statues to be a novelty to say the least. There
are even some enterprising individuals who keep cockatrice farms in order to
harvest their droppings for stone trinkets (I assume they do not reveal to their
customers where they came from however).
```
```
5 sp 1 lb.
```
```
20 Cockatrice
Beak
```
```
The infamous beak of a cockatrice, capable of turning any living creature into
petrified stone. Despite common belief, the petrifying magic has nothing to do
with the cockatrice's saliva, but is entirely within the cockatrice's beak alone. Any
artificer worth their salt knows the techniques to turn an undamaged beak into a
weapon that shares the cockatrice's petrifying ability.
```
```
1 gp 1 lb. Petrifying
Dagger

### Couatl

```
DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
15 Couatl
Venom
(vial)
```
```
The venom of a couatl is entirely non-lethal, reflective of the couatl's pacifist nature.
Couatl are in fact known for occasionally secreting this venom for the mortals they
partner with in the hopes of averting deaths wherever possible.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one
slashing or piercing melee weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next
10 minutes, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw, or become poisoned for 24 hours. Until this poison ends, the target is
unconscious. A creature automatically wakes up if they receive damage or if an
adjacent creature spends their action to wake them up.
```

The feathers of a couatl are extraordinarily vibrant, yet as soft as down. A particular
pillow has been made with these feathers that shares the couatl's ability to shield its
mind from external psychic threats. Powerful people have been known to use these
pillows to shield their sleeping moments from intrusion, as well as to just get an
extremely comfortable sleep.

The bones of a hand that has been transformed by necromantic
manipulation are notable for still carrying trace elements of those same
energies. They are not useful for much, but it is said that a set of dice carved
from these knucklebones roll lower than is statistically likely, giving rise to
the ubiquitous unlucky gambler term: "the dead man's hand."

The enormous lid of a cyclops is made of a strange material, quite different to the
rest of the cyclops' skin. The purpose of this is still a mystery, but various crafters
have managed to take its esoteric properties and use it for their own entertaining
projects.
```

20 Cyclops

```
```
Once they are roused to interest, cyclopses are known to relentlessly pursue
whatever it is they set their eye on. Experiments on cyclops remains have revealed
that the eye itself is partly to blame, as its unique situation forces the cyclops to
focus on one thing for prolonged periods of time. Artificers have taken this
property and applied it into a battle aid that doubles as a stylish dinner party
accessory.

### Death Knight

```
DC Item Description ValueWeight Crafting
```
```
15 Blighted
Ash
(small

```
```
When the flesh of a defeated death knight is burned in a ritual fire, the resulting
ashes retain the same dark aura of its original form. If one has the resolve for it,
these ashes can be mixed with oils and special powders then applied to the
body to gain certain protections from the undead.
Use: You may mix these ashes with 20 gold pieces worth of rare oils and
powdered gems to create a paste that grants certain defences against undead
when rubbed into the body. For 24 hours after using it on yourself, undead
creatures have disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find
you. In addition, you gain resistance to any necrotic damage dealt from an
undead source and advantage on any saving throw imposed by an undead
creature.

Blood is a generous term to apply to the coagulated muck that cloys in a death

versatile reagent in certain desecration rituals and blood curses. Use with
caution.

Even though a death knight may fall in battle, its dark curse will eventually form
a new body somewhere and force its soul to continue its mockery of life. If one
takes its heart and preserves it in a secret ritual, the death knight's new body will
be formed without the organ. From then on, the missing heart can be used as a
method of tracking the death knight, beating whenever it senses its old master
nearby.

The disintegrated remains of a demilich's body. Everytime you look away, it

necromantic magics.
```
```
800 gp 2 lb.
```
```
20 Demilich
Smoke
(vial)
```
```
Rather than a corporeal body, most of the demilich's shape consists of a choking
vapour that smells like forgotton tombs. This smoke contains an almost
insignificantly small fraction of the demilich's true essence, but if bottled and
stored properly, can be turned into an item to track the demilich wherever it may
reappear. Requires enchancted vial.

The demilich disciples of Acererak practice a particularly notorious necromantic
magic: inserting soul gems into their empty eye sockets to steal the spirits of
their victims. While taking the gem away from a defeated demilich is simply a
matter of picking it up, turning it over to your own control is considerably harder
and requires a complicated ritual soon after the demilich's defeat. A successful
result grants the bearer a powerful, but dark magical artifact.

### Demons

_"Demons are a nasty bunch, and even nastier to harvest. Looking past the fact that they possess unholy strength, vitality, and
power; they don’t even leave behind a useful carcass if slain in the Material Plane! Instead, they dissolve into a useless ichor
while their spirit scurries back to the Abyss. Imagine the gall of these beings: to lose an honest fight, and then not give up your
spoils to the victor! The impropriety!_

_P.S. Of course, other than that I should mention that using anything harvested from a demon comes with a certain risk of
spiritual erosion, eternal damnation, demonic corruption, et cetera."_ - Hamund

Due to their abyssal nature, demons slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcass dissolves into a foul
ichor instead. This ichor serves no purpose and is effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed
in the Abyss.

Furthermore, using parts harvested from a demon comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after
their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a demon part, roll a d20. On a 10 or less, that player
contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only
removed when the player is targeted by the _remove curse_ spell or similar magic. If a character is cured of a curse caused by an

attunement item, they are not allowed to attempt to attune to that item again. The DM may pick the curse themselves, or roll
for it on the table below.

If the curse came from a non-consumable item, there is an additional aspect of the curse that reads: “You have a constant need

to be within reach of the cursed item and are unwilling to part from it. You feel a need to have it equipped whenever feasibly
possible.”

###### Fiendish Curse

```
d6Curse
```
```
1 You feel a rage constantly bubbling under your emotions, threatening to burst at any moment. Whenever a hostile
creature damages you, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must
use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack
action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after your fell your current target. If
you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no
creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.
2 An unholy aura surrounds your spirit at all times. While this aura is invisible to any being that cannot see magic
directly, creatures nevertheless feel its effects subconsciously and shun those who bear it. While cursed like this, you
have disadvantage on any Animal Handling check and any Persuasion check made to try to persuade a non-evil
creature.
3 The demonic tinge in your body makes you no different to a normal demon in the eyes of those who hunt them. You
are considered to have an evil alignment regardless of your actual alignment, and your type is considered to be fiend,
along with your regular type. You have disadvantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) check made to convince a good-
aligned creature, and you also gain a vulnerability to radiant damage.
4 Constant whispers fill your mind, confusing your thoughts and weakening your resolve. You have disadvantage on all
Wisdom saving throws.
```
```
5 Your fiendish corruption weakens your resolve when fighting against other demons. You have disadvantage on attack
rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special attacks.
6 An unnatural hunger pervades your thoughts and enfeebles your movements. Any time you go more than 3
consecutive hours without eating at least 1 pound of food, make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. The DC increases by 5 for every additional 3 hours you spend without
consuming a pound of food. Both the DC and your exhaustion level is reset upon consuming at least 1 pound of
food.
```
##### Balor

##### Chasme

```
10 Chasme
Leg (x2)
```
```
A chasme's leg is capable of supporting its massive weight when walking on any
surface, even upside down. Intrepid adventurers have been known to repurpose
these legs as pitons which stick to surfaces rather than stab into them.
Use: You gain advantage on any Strength (Athletics) check made to climb walls so
long as you use these legs when doing so.
```
```
5 gp 20 lb.
```
```
15 Chasme
Proboscis
```
```
The proboscis of a chasme has a dark ubiquity among those that hunt demon
cults. Too often have they been found on tables of twisted instruments of torture,
used to extract blood from kidnapped victims before their inevitable sacrifice. It is
truly a horrid feeling to have one's life sucked away by a chasme proboscis, and I
would not wish it on my worst enemy.

The diaphonous wings of a chasme are perhaps their most dangerous appendage.
When vibrated at high speeds they create an unbearable buzzing not unlike a
monstrous cloud of flies. Ambitious tinkers have studied the physiology of a
chasme and figured out how to emulate their musculature in a machine capable of
making the same droning noise.

##### Dretch

```
DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
15 Fetid
Miasma
(vial)
```
```
If a dretch is useful for one thing it is to make a literal big stink. When masses of
these demons gather, the resulting effluent can be more dangerous than even a
rampaging balor.
Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a point
within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Any creature within 10 feet of that point must
make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next
turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus
action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.
```

##### Glabrezu

DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
10 Glabrezu
Horn
(x2)

The goat-like horn of a glabrezu. Does not contain much magical power in and of
itself, but some demonologists do enjoy grinding it up for their rituals, or speak
through it to lend credence to their voice.
```

Resembling the claws of a giant crab, the glabrezu's pincers have a grip that can
restrain even the strongest of creatures. Due to the glabrezu's natural fire
resistance, resourceful blacksmiths repurpose these pincers as forging tools when
working with magical flames.

The fur of a goristro resembles that of a wild bull and seems to constantly

the demon it came from, but the side effects may not be worth it.
```

```
```
1 lb. Potion of

20 Goristro
Hoof

A goristro's hoof is made of the same material as its infamous horns and thus
are just as hard. Wielding a hammer forged from these hooves is a surefire way
to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.

```
Castle architects and siege masters have an old joke, that if armies ever learned
how to train goristros, they'd both be out of a job. Indeed, the horn of the
goristro is stronger than castle stone walls and a single one of these demons are
capable of ending a siege by themselves. It takes a master craftsman to properly
grind these horns down, but the resulting dust can be used to reinforce a
weapon to make it as strong as the demon it was harvested from.

The blood of the hezrou is as thick and sludgy as week old garbage, and smells
just as bad. If you have the stomach for it however, injesting it with a few
neutralising herbs temporarily innoculates the body to foul miasmas and effluents.

The rank stench of the hezrou lingers in one's memory long after they have already
been removed from its presence. Removing this gland without rupturing it takes
an extrordinarily steady hand, but once harvested, can be thrown as a quick and
dirty bomb.
Use: As an action you may throw this item at a point within 20 feet, causing it to
explode on impact. Any creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.

The vapour from a defeated manes is a noxious substance that cloys in the throat and

```
Mariliths are renowned for the supernatural reflexes and inhuman co-ordination that
allows them to fight with six arms seamlessly. By placing their blood in a crucible, an
experienced alchemist can extract the adrenaline from a maralith's blood and mix it
into a potion that allows a mortal to temporarily emulate the agility of this fearsome
demon.

While their top halves may superficially resemble a humans with a few additional
limbs, the internal physiology of a marilith differs dramatically. Most noticeably in
their spines which have been adapted to support the numerous extra limbs and
lower appendage of this demon. This spine may serve as the frame of an audacious

While they may be yellow and stained from centuries of poor hygiene, the teeth
of a nalfeshnee are still made of a high quality ivory that surpasses those found in

The almost comically small wings of a nalfeshnee do not function on actual
physics to support its large weight, but rather sophisticated space displacement
magic that belies the nalfeshnee's brutish appearance. These wings are also
responsible for the nalfeshnee's ability to teleport, something that can be taken
advantage of by a skilled harvester.
Use: You may spend an action focusing on a wing in your hand. If you do so, you
magically teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to
120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once this item has been used
once, it loses all magical properties and becomes useless.

```
5 Quasit
Venom
(vial)
```
```
Quasit venom is more of an annoyance than a serious threat, but the paralysis side
effect can certainly ruin someone's day. When mixed with other ingredients however,
this venom can serve as one of many potential bases for a potion of poison.
```

Quasit blood is as thin and slippery as the demon it came from, but serves as an
excellent spell component for lower-tier magic.
Use: The next time you cast the find familiar spell, you may consume a vial of quasit
blood instead of using the usual material component of the spell. If you do, your
summoned familiar gains the magic resistance trait described in the quasit's statblock.
Your familiar also shares this trait with you so long as you are within 10 feet of it. Both
of these effects last for 1 hour, or until your familiar next disappears or is dismissed.

20 Demonic

```
As the shadow demon lacks a substantial form, there is nothing to harvest from it
except its spiritual essence. However, if one manages to capture this essence using
spirit paper, they will essentially hold complete dominion over said demon. At this
point, the spirit paper has a myriad of uses, but the most popular among
demonologists is to transfer the essence to a demon amulet. This gives the owner
the ability to resummon the demon in their proper physical form, while still
maintaining complete control over them. Requires spirit paper.

The collected spores of a vrock, requiring a special collection process and
preservation in oil to ensure they retain their potency even after the original owner's
death.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one
slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the spores takes 1 minute. For the next 10
minutes, the coated item is considered magical and any creature successfully hit by
this weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become
poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 1d10 poison damage at the
start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on
the target also ends the effect on it.

Yochlol's do not so much eat as they do engulf their prey. While the yochlol's
digestive enzymes are capable of dissolving just about anything given enough time,
there are occasionally a few items that gather inside the yochlol that do not break
down and instead stay inside its slime body. Like an oyster, the yochlol forms layers
around these undigestible materials, creating pearl-like substances. Unfortunately
these pearls share the same sickly yellow colour as the yochlol, making them more
novelties than anything else.

The ooze of a yochlol is said to be more poisonous than that of the deadliest spiders
in the world. It is ironic then that the other societies of the Underdark use this poison
against the drow after they have defeated their demonic servants.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one
slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next
minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw,
taking 6d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw.

_“Devils are just as bad as demons in terms of harvesting. To have the nerve of making me go all the way to the Nine Hells just
to harvest some devil blood is the height of rudeness. As a small upside, their ichor does make for a wonderful substance with_

_which to tar one’s roof.”_ - Hamund

Due to their fiendish nature, devils slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcasses dissolve into a foul
ichor or disappear into smoke instead. These serve no purpose and are effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a
demon, they must be killed in the Nine Hells.

Furthermore, using parts harvested from a devil comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after
their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a devil part, roll a d20. On a 10 or less, that player
contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only

removed when the player is targeted by the _remove curse_ spell or similar magic. If a character is cured of a curse caused by an
attunement item, they are not allowed to attempt to attune to that item again. The DM may pick the curse themselves, or roll
for it on the table below:

If the curse came from a non-consumable item, there is an additional aspect of the curse that reads: “you have a constant need
to be within reach of the cursed item and are unwilling to part from it. You feel a need to have it equipped whenever feasibly
possible.”

###### Fiendish Curse

```
d6Curse
1 You feel a rage constantly bubbling under your emotions, threatening to burst at any moment. Whenever a hostile
creature damages you, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must
use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack
action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after your fell your current target. If
you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no
creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.
```
```
2 An unholy aura surrounds your spirit at all times. While this aura is invisible to any being that cannot see magic
directly, creatures nevertheless feel its effects subconsciously and shun those who bear it. While cursed like this, you
have disadvantage on any Animal Handling check and any Persuasion check made to try to persuade a non-evil
creature.
```
```
3 The devilish tinge in your body makes you no different to a normal devil in the eyes of those who hunt them. You are
considered to have an evil alignment regardless of your actual alignment, and your type is considered to be fiend,
along with your regular type. You have disadvantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) check made to convince a good-
aligned creature, and you also gain a vulnerability to radiant damage.
```
```
4 Constant whispers fill your mind, confusing your thoughts and weakening your resolve. You have disadvantage on all
Wisdom saving throws.
```
```
5 Your fiendish corruption weakens your resolve when fighting against other devils. You have disadvantage on attack
rolls against devils and on saving throws against their spells and special attacks.
```
```
6 An unnatural hunger pervades your thoughts and enfeebles your movements. Any time you go more than 3
consecutive hours without eating at least 1 pound of food, make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. The DC increases by 5 for every additional 3 hours you spend without
consuming a pound of food. Both the DC and your exhaustion level is reset upon consuming at least 1 pound of
food.

Touching a barbed devil is like sleeping in a bed of porcupines. Incredibly sharp and

particular sets of armour and equipment. Otherwise they serve as building material
for sturdy arrows and bolts.

Barbed devils fight with a frenzy unmatched by many mortal creatures. As such, by
the time you finish hunting them, their carcass is so damaged that their hide
becomes effectively useless. If you manage to skin one properly however, the hide
can be treated, tanned, and turned into a cloak that is perfect for deterring anyone
who thinks that hugging is an acceptable form of greeting.

A bearded devil fights with a ferocity unmatched by any mortal. Even in the rare
occurances in which a bearded devil unit finds itself outnumbered, they continue to

this poison maintains its potency and is often used by assassins targetting magically
talented individuals.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one
slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next
minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw,
or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit

The chains of this devil's namesake occupy a unique space between animate and

Although the erinyes is a master warrior whose swordplay is matched by few mortals,
they are not above poisoning their weapons to further tip the scales in their favour.
Use: Can coat up to 10 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 1 hour.
Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit must succeed a
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 3d8 poison damage and be poisoned. The
poison lasts until it is removed by the lesser restoration spell or similar magic.

It is said that the first erinyeses were fallen angels, corrupted by exposure to the
fiendish energies of the Abyss. Whether or not that is true, the heart of an erinyes
certainly possesses some degree of corrupting influence itself and can be used as a
magical reagent when crafting a cursed weapon.
Use: Upon successful creation of a weapon or piece of armour that requires
attunement to use, the crafter may use the erinyes heart to perform a ritual that
curses the newly made piece of equipment. If they do so, the crafted equipmet
carries a random curse from the "fiendish curses" table. Performing this ritual
destroys the erinyes heart.

The stinger of an imp can be surprisingly dangerous if one receives a full dose of the

Use: Can coat up to 5 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 10 minutes.
Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit must make a DC 11

Imps are well known for their constant drone, incessantly gibbering promises of
power and corruption to their so called "masters." In death however, their tendency to
spy and spill secrets can be put to better use. An imp's severed head, along with some
choice necromantic rituals and artificing can create a magical censer that alerts its
owner to the presence of fiends in the vicinity.

The blobbish, fetid body of the lemure is useful for little in both life and in death.
Their essence on the other hand is much more useful, as it serves as the currency of
the Nine Hells (due to price fluctuations, the value of an individual lemure soul may
differ depending on the time of reading). As the lemure technically belongs to the
devil who corrupted its original soul in the first place, do beware when harvesting
these as there may be a devil who is less than pleased about being robbed.

A pit fiend's blood hisses, boils, and bubbles long after it has been removed
from its body, as if the fiend's wrath at its enemies continues even after its
death. Cooling this blood and seperating out the plasma can create a potion that
grants the drinker the same unholy vitality of its original owner.

10 Pit

Venom

```
A pit fiend's venom is one of the most insidious of all the fiends. Besides the
horrible pain they inflict on their victim, its corrupting influence even blocks out
magical assistance, keeping wounds open and bleeding even in the face of
divine help.
Use: Can be used to up to 15 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or 1
slashing or piercing weapon for 1 hour. Applying takes 1 minute. Any creature
successfully hit must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or become
poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points, and it
takes 6d6 poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The poisoned target
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.

detach this fiend's head from its body, haul it back to an artificer for reforging,
and then wear it proudly despite knowing the retribution that they may face
from those that pit fiend considered its ally; that person rightfully deserves to
be feared by the lessers around them.

When the black, glittering blood of the displacer beast is dried into a paste

### Doppelganger

_"I once heard an amusing anecdote about a doppelganger that attended a party with the intention of seducing the love interest
of the man whose identity they had stolen. Little did they know that the love interest was also a doppelganger that had been
come to seduce him. Long story short, they're married now (still in their stolen identities) and run a successful inn by the
coast."_ - Hamund

```
DC Item Description ValueWeight Crafting
```
```
10 Doppelganger
Blood (3
vials)
```
```
The blood of the doppelganger is unnervingly slick and in its natural state
carries the same rainbow sheen as a puddle of oil. When it is being held, it
changes colour to match the blood of the creature holding it.
Use: When you drink a vial of this blood that has had a drop of a humanoid's
blood mixed into it, you polymorph into a form identical to that humanoid for
the next 1d4 hours. Your statistics, other than your size remain the same in
that form. Any equipment you are carrying or wearing is not transformed. You
revert to your true form at the end of the duration or if you die.
```
```
4 gp 1 lb.
```
```
15 Doppelganger
Face
```
```
Although the thought may be unpleasent, the skinned face of the
doppelganger can provide several uses when used as a mask. Even in death,
the doppelganger's face maintains a "muscle memory" of the last few
identities that it impersonated. With some concentration, someone wearing
the face can force it to dredge up this memory and change the wearer's
appearance to that identity.
Use: While wearing the doppelganger face, a creature may spend 1 minute
visualising a humanoid that the doppelganger has shapeshifted into within
the past 24 hours. At the end of that minute, the face mask fuses with the
wearer, causing their head to shapeshift into a perfect replica of the
visualised humanoid along with their voice. Nothing else about the wearer's
body changes however. After 24 hours, the mask seperates from the wearer,
transforming them back into their regular form. The mask then deteriorates
into a useless sheet of skin.

A doppelganger's deception is aided by their low level of telepathic ability.

### Dracolich

_“When a dracolich's spirit enters the corpse of another dragon, it begins a blasphemous process that transforms the corpse
into something more suited to the dracolich’s dark preferences. Not only is this an affront to all that is natural, it wastes a
perfectly good dragon carcass. More than once have I downed a mighty dragon, only to find my assistants were draconic
cultists who immediately stole my prize out from under me by lobbing a spirit gem at it. You can only imagine the umbrage I_

_felt not only at now having to fend off an undead dragon, but also losing my chance of having dragon steaks for supper.”_ -

The process that transforms a dragon carcass into a dracolich does more than
simply slough off flesh and skin, it also changes the entire nature of the dragon
and suffuses it with an unholy energy that marks it even after the dracolich's spirit
is driven off once again. If these bones are taken, ground to a dust and then
infused in a magical censer, the user can divine the location of the dracolich's
spirit gem and put an end to it once and for all.

The scales of the shadow dragon are a curious colour that can
only be described as the colour of a shadow at dusk. Despite
their ethereal appearance however, they maintain their
incredible durability and strength. If forged into a suit of
armour, it can make even the bulkiest of knights disappear
when in darkness.

The ever shifting wings of the shadow dragon make it appear
more like a dark cloud when it swoops upon its prey. They are
more fragile than regular dragon wings and require great care
when harvested, however these same special properties make
them invaluable when crafting implements of flight and
stealth.

### Dragons

_“Of all the trophies that a hunter can bag, a true dragon tops the list. Physical embodiments of fire, lightning, cold, poison, and
acid; all wrapped up in iron-hard scales and gale-force wings. One would be a fool to hunt these creatures alone; to hunt them
with friends only marginally less so. But the rewards are great. Almost every part of these magical creatures are useful in
some way, whether it be for crafting, spellwork, or just a culinary delight. Still, it is important to note that the older and larger a_

_dragon is, the more valuable the game. The parts of a properly harvested young dragon alone can sell for thousands of gold
pieces, but the proceeds from an ancient dragon would put you, your children, and your children’s children in comfort for life.”_

- Hamund

Dragons are identified in 4 stages of life: Wyrmling, Young, Adult, and Ancient. The harvesting tables below outline the
different types, quantities, and qualities of parts that can be harvested from dragons at different stages of their lives. When
noting down the parts harvested, it is important to note which age bracket of the dragon being harvested, as the value of the
part and its utility in crafting varies wildly between age groups.

The harvesting table does not differentiate between the different colours/metals of the dragon it was harvested from. Instead,
[Type] is used as a stand-in. When noting down the harvested part, replace [Type] with the colour/metal of the dragon it was
harvested from. This is important, as different dragons are aligned with different damage types and resistances, which will

ultimately change the nature of items crafted from that part.

Some crafted items will have differing levels of power depending on what age group the dragon it was crafted from belonged
in. For example, dragon bone can be crafted into any weapon, but that weapon will have a different bonus depending on the

dragon’s age: +1 for young, +2 for adult, and +3 for ancient. The crafted item will specify in its description when such a
distinction makes a difference.

Crafted items may also change their nature depending on the colour/metal of the dragon it was crafted from. If a crafted items

description refers to the “harvested dragon’s damage type,” refer to the following table to determine that damage type.

```

When the word "dragon" is uttered, people tend to think of three
things: wings, scales, and breath. Located at the back of the dragon's
throat is a basket sized sack of magical liquids that the dragon naturally
produces. While the liquid and their resulting exhalation differ
depending on the dragon, they all share the same destructive results.
Harvesting one of these without rupturing them is almost as difficult as
killing its host in the first place, but the result is a concentrated pouch
of destruction.
Use: May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any
target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer
the effects of the primary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested
from. The saving throw type and DC, the damage type, and the damage
amount are identical to the breath weapon of the dragon it was

When the word "dragon" is uttered, people tend to think of three things:
wings, scales, and breath. Located at the back of the dragon's throat is a
basket sized sack of magical liquids that the dragon naturally produces.
While the liquid and their resulting exhalation differ depending on the
dragon, they all share the same destructive results. Harvesting one of
these without rupturing them is almost as difficult as killing its host in the
first place, but the result is a concentrated pouch of destruction.
Use: May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any
target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer
the effects of the primary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested
from. The saving throw type and DC, the damage type, and the damage
amount are identical to the breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested
from.

The metallic dragons are considered to be less violent than their
chromatic cousins and this is reflected in their alternate breath weapons.
While their primary breath weapons mimic those of the chromatics, all
metallics dragons wield a secondary, much less harmful breath weapon.
This too can be harvested and used for similar purposes as the primary
dragon breath pouch.
Use: May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any
target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer
the effects of the secondary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested
from. The saving throw type, DC, and the effect are identical to the
secondary breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from.

```
An old sailor's adage held that the dragon turtle was the king of the ocean and that
no denizen of the deeps would dare to approach them without permission. As such,
it became a common good luck ritual to mix dragon turtle blood with tar and coat
important ships with it. Later research found that this ritual was more than just a
folk tale and that certain aquatic creatures have developed an instinctual revulsion
when they smell a dragon turtle nearby.

The plastron of the dragon turtle is the cartilage-like substance that protects the
underbelly of the dragon turtle. Not nearly as tough as the shell of the dragon turtle,
it nonetheless has its uses. When ground up, mixed with herbs, and set into a jelly, it
creates a life-saving (if unpalatable) medicine.

20 Steam
Ventral
```
```
A basket sized organ located alongside the lungs. When the dragon turtle inhales
water, some is stored inside this organ, where it reacts with enzymes that rapidly
accelerate heating. While it appears nominally that this organ is meant to provide
the dragon turtle with warmth during its deep sea dives, it doubles as a defense
mechanism, allowing the dragon turtle to spit jets of scalding steam from its mouth.
When harvested, it maintains this property, but lacks both the muscular support for
long ranges and the ability to refill on enzymes, giving it a short shelf life.
Use: As an action, a creature may squeeze the steam ventral to release a 30-foot
cone of scalding steam. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution
saving throw, taking 15d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistsance against this damage.
This ability can only be used within 48 hours of the dragon turtle's death. Once
used, the steam ventral is emptied out and rendered useless.

### Drider

_“You would think that a drider’s top half is identical internally to its original drow body, but you would be wrong. In fact, a
drider’s old drow torso is incredibly mutated to match its new physiology, and no two seem to be alike. Indeed, some driders
have been noted to either keep some of their original organs and grow duplicates in their spider halves, or just find their
original ones liquefy completely, leaving their torsos as nothing but glorified head-supports.”_ - Hamund

```
10 Drider
Oil (4
vials)
```
```
Anybody who has observed a spider will notice that they do not stick to their own
webs, and a drider is no exception. For the drider, this comes in the form of a gland
that secretes an oily substance that covers the almost invisible hairs on their legs. This
oil prevents them from sticking to any sort of webbing and also contributes to the
black sheen on their bodies.
Use: 1 vial contains enough oil to cover one medium or smaller sized creature. A
creature covered by this oil gains the drider's web walker feature for the next hour.
```
```
4 gp 1 lb.
```
```
15 Drider
Poison
(vial)
```
```
Drider poison is just as deadly as those of the cave spiders it emulates. By removing
the gland from under the drider's tongue however, this poison can be extracted and
put to better use.
Use: Can coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or 1 slashing or
piercing weapon for 10 minutes. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature
successfully hit receives an additional 2d8 poison damage.

Unbenownst to many is that each drider is marked by more than just the physical
transformation of their lower body into that of a giant spider. Each drider also receives
a permanent mark in the shape of the symbol of Lolth. The issue is that the location of
this mark changes with each individual drider, so a thorough investigation of the
carcass is required to find it. Once that is done however, the mark provides uses in
channelling certain powers from the drow goddess, even against her own will.

Hair is used as a loose term, as the material covering a dryad's head more resembles

conquest of a dryad...in either sense of the term.
```
```

```
10 Dryad
Sap
(vial)
```
```
Instead of blood, dryads have a sap-like substance flowing through their bodies. This
sap contains magical properties and can enhance the durability of a creature that is
rubbed on. Use: Can be used to coat one medium or smaller creature. Applying the
sap takes 1 minute, after which the sap takes effect. While under the effect of the sap,
that creature is under an effect idential to that of the barkskin spell. This effect does
not require any concentration check to maintain however. This effect lasts for 1 hour.

gaze into them and not be enthralled. The eyes maintain these properties even after
the dryad is killed and their eyes transfigured into useful equipment for adventurers.

Due to their years of slavery to the illithid race, duergar have developed a range

race regardless of training. If one dissects the brain of a duergar, they will find
that their brainstem is particularly large and often pulsates even after death. This
brainstem may be used as an ingredient in various potions that temporarily grant
the drinker the same powers as an average duergar.

_"Personally, I would avoid harvesting an empyrean if for whatever reason you come across its corpse. You don't want their
parents to find you walking around with their child's heart as a trinket."_ - Hamund

Carrying the remains of an empyrean make you particularly susceptible to the scrying attempts of the divine parent of that
empyrean. While holding any material taken or crafted from an empyrean, you automatically fail the saving throw associated
with the casting of the _scry_ spell, or similar ability, by the parent of that empyrean.

The hair of an empyrean is akin to silk in both its lustre and texture, another sign

ties and ropes. If you want to use it for less mundane purposes however, it makes
for a good material component in the augury spell; the hairs changing colour
depending on your fate. It would be advised however not to attempt this if your

Ettercaps secrete a noxious venom from their fangs that weakens any creature

Use: Can be used to coat up to 3 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one

minute, any creature successfully hit by this wepaon must make a DC 11

Alternatively, it can just be lobbed at a foe to make a sticky explosion.
Use: As an action, you may throw the web gland up to 15 feet. Upon impact with the
ground, the web gland explodes, forcing all creatures within 5 feet to succeed on a
DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by webbing. As an action, the
restrained creature can make a DC 11 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on

traces of it, even after the faerie dragon's death.
Use: This ability may only be used if the faerie dragon had access to its euphoria
breath ability at the time of its death. As an action, you may squeeze the faerie
dragon's lungs at one creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11

telepathic probes. This is in part due to the thin membrane around its soft body
that serves a similar function to the epiglottis in humanoids. This membrane
prevents the flumph from psionically feeding on every creature around it, and is
only turned off manually when the flumph is hungry. This membrane however
does break down quickly with the death of the flumph.
Use: While a creature is wearing the flumph membrane over their head, they are
immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well
as all divination spells. The membrane loses this trait 24 hours after the death of
its flumph.

The many carbuncles, blisters, pustules, and boils of a fomorian may seem

Spore
Gas
(vial)

The lighter than air gas that allows a gas spore to fly remains potent even after it is
popped. It takes a quick hand and a deep breath to bottle some without accidentally
breathing deadly gas spores, however. Requires enchanted vial.
```
```
5 sp 1 lb. Floating

```
```
15 Gas
Spore
Colony
(vial)
```
```
Collecting the deadly spores of a gas spore must be done within one round of the
creature's death, as spores that land in inorganic matter become useless. Collection of
these spores must be done in a vial that contains a few drops of a creature's blood to
give the spore colony the nutrients it needs to survive. While the spores are dangerous
to inhale, drinking them also carries a risk, unless the spores are dropped in alcohol,
which kills the spores.
Use: As an action, the vial may be thrown up to 20 feet at a target creature, shattering
on impact. Make a ranged attack against that creature. On a successful hit, that
creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects
described in the death burst trait of the gas spore's statblock. This item must be used
within 24 hours of the death of the initial gas spore's death, otherwise the colony will
grow too large in the vial to properly invade another creature's system.

It is difficult to remove the gills of a shrieker without damaging them, however it

Scotch," the taste of which has been described as "loud." If you are not a fan of
alcohol, it can simply be used for magical purposes.
Use: The shrieker spore colony may be expended as a material component when
casting the alarm spell. When cast in this way, the caster does not use a spell slot.

The joints of a galeb-duhr are of a slightly different mineral compound

it makes for an excellent ingredient for magical chalk.

20 Galeb-
Duhr Core
```
```
Unlike a regular earth elemental, galeb-duhr's have a strong tie to the Material
Plane, and this is reflected in their possession of a "core." Often referred to as
the galeb-duhr's heart, this magical stone serves as the basis of the galeb-duhr
and is the physical embodiment of their identity and form. If recovered
undamaged, it can be used to create a new galeb-duhr.
Use: The galeb-duhr core must be placed inside a pile of rocks the size of a
medium humanoid on the night of a full moon. Until the next full moon, the
person that placed the core must cast the conjure elemental spell on top of the
chosen pile of rocks every day at the same hour as the placing and maintain
concentration on the spell for the full hour. When cast in this way, no elemental
actually appears, but the spell slot is still expended. If done correctly, the pile of
rocks will coalesce into a galeb-duhr upon casting conjure elemental on the next
full moon. The galeb-duhr is friendly to its summoner and understands anything
its summoner says to it even if they do not share a language. The summoned
galeb-duhr obeys any order its summoner gives to it to the best of its abilities. A
galeb-duhr summoned in this way also remembers any memories its core had
experienced in its previous lives. This galeb-duhr does not disappear at the end
of the hour and is only dispersed upon its death.

This black tar-like substance resembles the coagulated blood found on murdered

Use: You may spend 1 minute to cover yourself in ghast blood. If you do so, undead

Use: As an action, you may throw the ghast flesh up to 20 feet away, the corpulent
flesh bursting on impact. Any creature within 5 feet of the targetted point must
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its

The githyanki are not originally a species native to Limbo, and yet they have made it
their home regardless. Their existence there is a paradox; a stretch of serenity in an
otherwise chaotic sea. This is reflected in their own bodies which have gradually
adapted to living in such a place. Their hearts in particular are noteworthy to
scholars trying to unlock the power of that plane.

The githzerai brain is a marvel of biology. Capable of psionic output powerful
enough to bend the normal laws of physics, it is noticebly larger and more
developed than most other humanoid's. Although doing so may be distasteful for
civilised folk, consuming the brain of a githzerai can temporarily boost the latent
psionic powers of other humanoids, granting them similar abilities to its previous
owner.
Use: As an action, you may consume the githzerai brain. For the next hour, you may
cast the mage hand spell as a cantrip, as well as cast the feather fall spell up to 3
times.

The githzerai practice many rituals in their constant adherence to discipline and

be earned after the githzerai have demonstrated a mastery of a skill respected within
the githzerai culture. Young and novice githzerai may only have a simple brand of a
single skill, while the most revered and experienced in their society would have
intricate brands, developed and layered on each other over their many years of
learning. These brands are both rare and beautiful to admire, making them valuable
to collectors elsewhere.

Use: If at least 1 pound of flesh golem meat is consumed, whether raw or cooked,
the eater enters a berserker rage. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem
attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to
and attack, the eater attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than
itself. This effect lasts for 1 minute, or until a creature that the eater trusts
succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to calm them.

Use: As an action you may squeeze the sack and release a petrifying gas
in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to
stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving
throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effects ends on the
target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater

tentacles meet its body, this poison can be extracted and used against one's own
enemies.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one
slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next
minute, any creature successfully hit must succed on a DC 15 Constitution saving

voracious apetite and low intelligence, sometimes this stuff includes the treasures
of the hapless victims that cross its path. In rare circumstances, these treasures
can sit in the grick's digestive system for a prolonged time and form a pearl. This
pearl resembles whatever mish mash of materials created it, but coated with what
appears to be a supernaturally dark hue that never goes away despite the lighting.
This pearl can be taken by artificers and crafted into an item that taps into its

## Harvest Table: H

### Hags

_“The rules for hags is the same as that of disasters: they’re dangerous, they’re best to be avoided, and they tend to come in
threes. Harvesting a hag is also a dangerous proposition as contact with their bodily fluids carries the risk of contracting the
dreaded ‘crone’s disease.’ Great care should always be exercised when carving up one of these ladies, otherwise you run the
risk of looking like my childhood nanny for the rest of your life"_ - Hamund

Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death.
Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting
“Crone’s Disease.” Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a DC 15

Constitution saving throw or become infected with crone’s disease. A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest
anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting crone’s disease as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open
wound.

Upon contracting crone's disease, 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like.
For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the
saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to
normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7

days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative
magic such as that of the spell _greater restoration_ may return the creature to their normal appearance.

neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that
information is entirely out of this writer's control.

this latent power to create a magical trinket with much of the same property. In
several ways, the hag would probably have enjoyed the idea of its carcass being

### Half Dragon

```
DC Item Description ValueWeight Crafting
```
```
10 Half-
Dragon
Blood
(3
vials)
```
```
While regular dragon blood is too foreign to have any effect on a humanoid
without significant alteration, the diluted nature of a half-dragon's blood allows it
to bestow significant benefits on a humanoid imbiber.
Use: As an action you may drink the vial of half-dragon blood. For the next 10
minutes, you gain the same type of damage resistance of the half-dragon it was
taken from.
```
```
8 gp 1 lb.
```
```
15 Half-
Dragon
Scales
(small

```
```
Half-dragons occupy an odd position in the taxonomy of creatures. This is best
reflected in the strange effect that their bodies have on the senses of real dragons
around them. Their strange physiology seems to cause them to slip beneath the
notice of dragons of their own colour, tricking them into thinking they are one of
their own. Taking a half-dragon's scales, grinding them into a powder, and then
mixing them with oil creates a paste that other humanoids can apply to their own
bodies to avoid or promote detection by dragons.

excellent quills.
```
```

```
15 Harpy

If harpies are known for one thing, it is their singing. Their vocal cords are able to
produce a wide variety of sounds, and some daring bards have taken to using them
as strings for their instruments. Bards with instruments of the harpies are said to play
music that can entrance entire rooms of listeners.
```

```
20 Harpy
Egg
```
```
On a rare occasion, you may slay a harpy that was in the middle of ovulation.
Whether the egg is fertilised is irrelevant, as it is the eggshell that holds the true
value. When this pink-speckled shell is powdered, it makes a dye with potent magical
abilities.

Fur (3

```
When a hell hound dies, it is consumed by its internal fire leaving nothing behind but
ash of burnt fur. While this is disapointing to harvesters, the fur still has some utility.
Use: As an action, you may rub 1 tuft of hell hound fur into your hands. If you do so,
for the next minute, whenever you roll a 1 or 2 on a fire damage dice roll, you may
reroll that die and you must use the new number. After being used, the tuft of hell
hound fur loses its magic and becomes useless.

### Helmed Horror

DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
10 Helmed
Horror
Helmet
```
```
When crafting a helmed horror, no ordinary helmet will do. One made specifically for
the purpose must be comissioned in order to grant the unique senses that the
helmed horror possesses. With some time, an artificer can take one of these helms
and reconfigure the arcane signatures so that they work for regular humanoids.
```

8 lb. Blinders

```
15 Helmed
Horror
Essence
```
```
The animating spirit of a helmed horror dissipates quickly after its form loses
structural integrity. If done quickly however, this spirit can be caught using a sheet of
spirit paper. No matter how quick you may be however, some of the spirit will have
degraded already, thus any attempt at reusing the spirit is sure to result in a lower
quality construct than the original helmed horror. Requires spirit paper.
Use: You may spend an hour performing a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check with
the spirit paper to transfer the essence to an unworn suit of plate armour. If you are
successful, the essence leaves the spirit paper and enters the suit of armour, creating
an animated armour under your control. This armour follows your instructions to the
best of its ability, but lacks the intelligenec to discern any nuance from your words
and follows orders to the letter. This animated armour remains until it is destroyed.

```
10 Hippogriff

feathers for fletching high quality arrows.

It is said that a hippogriff can spot a mouse in a field from more than 2 miles over.

hundred feet out, and this is another reason that hippogriffs are so highly valued as
mounts and companions.

The destroyed body of a homunculus returns to its mundane components upon
its death. These components can be recycled into a new homunculus.
```
```
40 gp 6 lb.
```
```
20 Homunculus
Blood (vial)
```
```
The homunculus' blood is the same as its master's: a wizard must bleed onto an
empty construct in order to bring it to life. While this imparts a connection to
that wizard that they would find useful, it can also be exploited by others skilled
in the arcane arts who manage to capture said homunculus. As such, the price
of this blood can vary wildly depending on which wizard's homunculus it was
taken from. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: As an action you may drink the homunculus blood. Doing so gives you all
the knowledge that the homunculus had up to the point of its death, including
the languages it knew, and the knowledge that its creator shared with it. You
may not necessarily understand all of this knowledge, especially if it is of a very
esoteric nature and you may not necessarily be able to parse all of it. You retain
this knowledge for 10 minutes, after which all of it vanishes from your mind.
Once this happens, you become stunned for 1 minute as your mind recovers
from the influx of information it received.

Exoskeleton

The hooked horror's exoskeleton is harder than iron, but unfortunately is difficult
to reshape and thus unsuited for armour. However, it does have several other
uses including being used as a sturdy container, building material, or even as
using its reverberative nature as a percussion instrument. Many Underdark
cultures thus value these exoskeletons when recovered in good condition.

lose and grow new heads.

15 Hydra
Heart
Piece
```
```
An organ capable of scaling up blood circulation regardless of how many heads its
body grows, the heart of a hydra is brimming with magical potential. In fact, the heart
of a hydra is so powerful that consuming one can even regrow lost limbs.
Use: It takes 10 minutes to consume enough hydra heart to have an effect. Once
consumed, you regain all hit points as well as regrow any missing body parts. If a
body part is regrown in this way, you feel an intense feeling of hunger and suffer 1
level of exhaustion until you consume at least 5 pounds of food. The hydra heart
must be consumed within 24 hours upon the death of the hydra, otherwise it gives
no effect.

### Intellect Devourer

```
DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
15 Brain
Fluid
(vial)
```
```
The fluid that oozes through an intellect devourer is not unlike the mucus secreted
by their illithid masters. This fluid however has the unique ability to carry and pass
on memories to those that consume it.
Use: As an action you may drink a vial of brain fluid. If you do so you must make a
DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you become stunned for 1 minute as
your mind fails to process the information flooding through it. On a success, you
learn the identity of who this intellect devourer used to be, as well as one key
memory. The key memory is up to the discretion of the DM, but may be something
that the intellect devourer knew in its original life, or something it has learned after
becoming an intellect devourer.
```
```
4 gp 1 lb.
```
```
20 Living
Brainstem
```
```
Living is a strong word in this case. Used here, it really means that the brain still has
some capacity for interaction and response to stimuli, due largely to the dark rituals
used to transform it into an intellect devourer. While it would be much more
merciful to put the brain out of its misery by destroying it entirely, it still offers
some use for an adventurer with a strong stomach.
Use: For 6 hours after an intellect devourer's death, its main brain continues to
send weak signals of psionic wavelengths. When the brain is worn directly on top
of a humanoid's head, that humanoid becomes immune to the detect sentience
ability of intellect devourers. Instead, an intellect devourer that detects that
humanoid will assume that humanoid is a host of a living intellect devourer and will
treat them accordingly. However, an intellect devourer that can see without using
its blindsight will still notice that a humanoid is wearing a brain on the top of their
head and will also react accordingly.

of a breeze remains that futiley attempts to make its way to its quarry. If this wisp
is captured quickly and prevented from further degredation, it will continue
indefinitely attempting to reach its quarry. Resourceful trackers mix small amounts
of dye into this container to make a makeshift compass that will lead them to
whatever the invisible stalker was originally trying to hunt. Requires enchanted vial.

The mesmerising eyes of a jackalwere are able to lure unwary travellers into a
slumber, and many commonfolk that live in areas frequented by jackalweres make
a habit of looking down when speaking to strangers.
Use: If you cast the sleep spell you may use a jackalwere eye as a material
component. If you do so, you roll an additional 1d8 when determining the amount
of hit points affected. You may only use one jackalwere eye at a time, and once
used, a jackelware eye loses its magic and becomes useless.

_“I have never been fond of birds, and I find talking, thieving birds to be even worse. I once recall waking from a particularly
raucous night of revelry, only to find myself covered by street-kenkus, looting me like a freshly slain kill. They ran as soon as I
raised my fist at them of course, but by then, they had already taken everything off me, including my clothes. Needless to say, it

learn. From its watery domains, it has scoured ocean caverns hiding mysteries and
treasures that surface dwellers were never meant to see. By taking a kraken's eye and
subjecting it to a number of arcane rituals, these secrets can be revealed to a mind
capable of handling them.

Not many are aware that a kraken possesses 3 hearts, each with a slightly different
circulatory function. In artificing function however they all serve the same purpose.
By transfiguring them into crystals, they can be placed around a certain perimeter to
act as wards against disastrous environmental effects. Many of the oldest port cities
owe their longevity to these wards, or they would have been swept away by the tides
long ago.
Use: An artificer may spend 1 year performing a daily ritual to transform a kraken
heart into a large red crystal with the ability to dampen natural forces. When 3 of
these crystals are placed within 5 miles of each other, the area enclosed by them
always experiences fair weather. Rain in that area never results in flooding, and waves
are magically prevented from washing past the perimeter of that area.

Like some cephalapods, the brain of a kraken is actually divided into several areas,
particularly focused in their tentacles. In order to facilitate this odd physiology on
such a large scale, the main brain of the kraken has a certain electromagnetic quality
to it that not only allows it to control its massive body, but also influence sea
creatures and the area around it. If the right areas are harvested, they make a
powerful amulet that can mimic some of these abilities.

### Kuo-Toa

_“Be wary when harvesting a kuo-toa; their insides smell stronger of rotten fish than their outsides. If you do find your hands
stained with their horrid stench after harvesting them, a good tip is to soak them in the nearby ocean for a while. For whatever
reason, doing so seems to nullify the worst effects of it, but you may still be followed by seagulls for a while afters.”_ - Hamund

A lich's body is as much a part of it as a strand of hair on a normal human. It holds no
significant connection to it, and discards it with little fanfare. This is because the lich's
true power is located within its phylactery, its body acting as little more than a physical
conduit for its actions. When a lich is defeated however, not all of its wicked spirit
dissipates immediately. Quick action and powerful magic can bind the errant wisps of a
lich's essence, allowing one to craft a trinket to track the lich wherever they may reform.

The heart of a lizardfolk touched by Sess'Inek is as fetid and rotten as the swamp

body, making them stronger and more vicious than its brethren. Eating it can
bestow a temporary boon to a normal humanoid, but it is advised only to those
with a strong will.
Use: As an action, you may eat this item. Upon doing so, you gain the following
abilities for the next hour: you are able to hold your breath for 15 minutes, you
are immune to the frightened condition, your AC raises to 15 if it was lower than
that as your skin becomes scaly, and once per turn, you may deal an extra 3d6
damage on a successful melee weapon attack, and gain temporary hit points
equal to the extra damage dealt. Upon eating this item, you must also succeed on
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become berserk. While berserk, you must
attempt to make a melee weapon attack against the closest creature to you,
and/or move as close to them as possible. You remain berserk until the rest of
the effects of eating this item also end.

### Lycanthropes

_“As a whole, I do not make a sport of hunting lycanthropes. Even though their beastly nature would make them fair game, they
revert to their original form upon death, and as a whole I tend to avoid hunting and harvesting humanoids (for both ethical and
legal reasons).”_ - Hamund

A lycanthrope reverts to its true form when it dies, and as such, it should be treated as a member of its original species when
harvested. The only exception is in harvesting its blood, which is changed irrevocably due to the curse.

```

Their cursed blood is the one constant that all lycanthropes share regardless of

blood of a lycanthrope is not to be treated carelessly. In the hands of a skilled
alchemist, it can be used to dampen the worst side effects of lycanthropy, or
spread its contagion even further.
Use: As an action, you may drink the vial of lycanthrope blood and infect yourself
with lycanthropy. The effect is the same as if you were bitten by a lycanthrope of
the same type as that you took the blood from. For more information, refer to
page 207 of the Monster Manual.

The leftover shell of a magmin, composed of hard magma. It is quite hard and has

### Medusa

_“Medusas are interesting creatures to harvest for several reasons. The first is that it is quite difficult to harvest something you_

_are not allowed to look at directly, as the medusa’s petrifying gaze persists even after its death. The second, is that their
granite-like composition means that a medusa’s body does not decompose the way a normal creature would. As such, a freshly
harvested medusa head can remain recognisable (and thus usable) for many years.”_ - Hamund

Due to the fact that a medusa’s petrifying gaze remains active even beyond the death of the medusa, any character attempting
to harvest the medusa must do so while averting their gaze. Doing so imposes disadvantage on any check made to harvest the
medusa, unless that character is capable of another reliable method of perception.

```

The heart of a medusa is a sad one. Cursed by their own vanity, a sense of loneliness

can serve as the core reagent for cursing an item with the same uncontrollable vanity
of its original host.

stone. This property persists even into its death, and unfortunate adventurers can
find themselves accidentally petrified when they go to inspect their kill. Even though
the idea may be macabre, the preserved head of a medusa can be attached to
equipment to petrify any that gaze upon it.
Use: The head of the medusa carries the same petrifying gaze ability as listed in the
statblock of the medusa, with the exception that the head cannot petrify itself.

### Merfolk

_“Before they were widely known, tales of merfolk and their wondrous anatomies circulated across the land, often buoyed by

Compared to regular merfolk, the transformed nature of the merrow makes their

The mucus secreted by a well fed mind flayer has a slightly sticky texture and smells
roughly of weak formaldahyde. Filled with the thoughts and emotions of the mind
flayer's meals, this mucus can undergo an alchemical process to turn into an
intoxicating draught known as: Whisper. When consumed, the drinker experiences a

The incredibly powerful brain of the mind flayer seems to still throb with activity
even after removal from its skull. Due to the unique physiology of the illithid race,
the consciousness of the mind flayer is still present in the brain, allowing it to be
exploited by both adventurers and by the mind flayer's elder brain master alike.
Use: Despite being dead, the intact brain of a mind flayer is treated as if it were still a
living mind for the purposes of spells and abilities that can interact directly with
minds such as the detect thoughts spell. Any time a creature interacts with the mind
flayer brain in this way, there is a 10 per cent chance that the elder brain that the
mind flayer had a psychic link with becomes aware of this interaction and what
occured during this interaction.

_“To be honest, I’m not entirely sure modrons deserve to be in this book. Not only are constructs already a grey area when it

oils that curse a corpse with eternal undeath. While the magic can only be used on
one corpse, the magical reagents can be recycled by resourceful alchemists. As
such, these bandages can fetch a decent price.

The body of a cursed mummy remains cursed even after it has been rendered
inanimate. Taking the dry dust from this corpse can serve as the basis for a ghastly
potion once mixed with other oils and desert roots. Such a potion and fate should
only be reserved for those who have committed the worst of crimes (such as
making a mummy in the first place).

The heart of a mummy lord is not actually found in a mummy lord's chest but is
sequestered away in a separate container somewhere in the mummy lord's lair. It
takes great skill to remove and store the shrivelled organ without damaging it, but
if done correctly, can provide a powerful base for artificing. It is, however, advised
that one finishes their business with the heart quickly, before its owner comes
looking for it.

```
This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had uses of its
rapport spores ability. These spores have a unqiue ability to transmit thought
between the myconid and other intelligent beings. With some reverse engineering,
alchemists have managed to use these spores to create a potion that simulates a
similar effect in other creatures.

Spores

This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had use of its
pacifying spores ability. The pacifying spores of an adult myconid are capable of
stopping even the largest of creatures, if at least temporarily. Stored properly, they
can be packed into small clusters and used in much the same manner as their
original owner used them.
Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack and throw the pouch of
pacifying spores at a target within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11
Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

```
```
20 Hallucination
Spores
(small
pouch)
```
```
The hallucination spores created by the myconid sovereign create a strong
psychedelic effect in any creature that inhales them. Imbibers have described
visions of strong lights and strange images, and an overall satisfied feeling
afterwards. Underdark societies are known to hunt sovereigns down just for
these spores, which is a shame because most would happily share the spores
to any visitor who just asked politely.
Use: You may make a ranged weapon attack at a creature within 10 feet by
throwing the pouch at them. Upon a successful hit, the target must succeed on
a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned
target is incapacitated while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

25 Animating
Spores
(small

```
```
This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had use of
its animating spores ability. The animating spores of a myconid sovereign holds
a strange place between schools of magic. Holding characterstics of
necromantic, enchantment, and transfiguration, these spores continue to vex
even the foremost scholars of the day.
Use: As an action, you may sprinkle these spores over the corpse of a humanoid
or a Large or smaller beast within 5 feet. In 24 hours, the corpse rises as a
spore servant (refer to the Monster Manual for the statblock). The corpse stays
animated fo 1d4+1 weeks or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in
this way.

Naga
Heart
```
```
The heart of a guardian naga may be taken by force, but it is only useful when
given freely by the benevolent creatures. When eaten, the recipient gains the
naga's rejuvenation ability for at least one death. In exchange, the naga's own
cycle of rebirth is temporarily halted. A guardian naga only does this when it
sees great potential in a mortal creature and wishes to be a part of that
creature fulfilling their destiny.
Use: If the naga heart is taken and eaten under the free and willing permission
of the guardian naga, the eater temporarily gains the ability to return to life
after death. If the eater dies, they will return to life in 1d6 days and regain all
hit points, missing body parts, and be cured of all non-magical diseases. Only
a wish spell can prevent this trait from functioning. In addition, the naga from
whom the heart was taken loses its rejuvenation ability until the creature that
ate their heart returns to life for the first time using this ability. After the
eater returns to life for the first time using this ability, they lose this ability.

The nothic brain is immense; existing as both a testament and mockery to the
nothic's former intellectual callings. Despite its veil of madness, wells of knowledge
still exist within it, for those that know how to bring it out.
Use: You may spend 1 day pulping, drying, and mixing this item with various reagents.
The resulting mixture creates a magical ink that contains magical knowledge. A
character with at least 3 levels in the wizard class may use this ink to write in their
spellbook. If they do so, they subconsciously write down a random spell (chosen by
the DM) of 2nd level or lower into their spellbook. Regardless of the level of the spell,
this transcription takes 2 hours and costs nothing except the usage of all the ink. This
copied spell functions as well as any other spell copied into the book through a
mundane method.

An ogre has a repugnant odor that seems to combine mouldy cheese, sour feet, and

### Ogres


### Oozes

_“Oozes are a staple of any good adventure experience, and every good adventurer should know how to repurpose the nasty
things for their own uses. Best to exercise caution when harvesting them however, as their slime remains active even after the
animating force behind them is gone.”_ - Hamund

If you fail on an attempt to harvest any item from an ooze, you suffer half the acid damage associated with that oozes
_pseudopod_ ability as you spill the slime over yourself by accident.

##### Black Pudding

```
DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
10 Black
Residue
(vial)
```
```
A sample of a black pudding. Inert due to lacking enough biomass to constitute a full
ooze, it nevertheless retains its acidic properties. Can be used as a potent acid.
Requires enchanted vial.
Use: A vial of black residue can be poured onto nonmagical wood or metal. The black
residue eats through 2 inches of these materials per round for the next 10 rounds,
after which the ooze becomes too diluted to continue.

10 Gelatinous
Residue
(vial)
```
```
The gelatinous residue from a gelatinous cube carries much of the same acidic
properties from its original form. Unlike samples taken from other oozes, the
gelatinous cube's acid is difficult to identify when mixed with other liquids,
making it the substance of choice among assassins with a subtler touch. Requires
enchanted vial.
Use: Drinking the gelatinous residue automatically deals 6d6 acid damage to the
drinker. The gelatinous residue may be mixed with up to 5 oz. of other liquid and
still retain this property. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can identify a liquid
that has had gelatinous residue mixed into it.

##### Gray Ooze

```
DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
10 Gray
Residue
(vial)
```
```
Not as potent as a black pudding, but highly acidic nonetheless. Some blacksmithing
techniques actually use this acid in advanced smithing projects, but the difficulty and
volatility of controlling the residue has made this a rather esoteric artform. Requires
enchanted vial.
Use: A vial of gray residue can be poured on a piece of nonmagical metal. This ooze
will eat through 2 inches of that metal every round for the next 10 rounds, after
which it becomes too diluted to continue.
```
```
7 gp 1 lb.
```
##### Ochre Jelly

```
DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
10 Ochre
Residue
(vial)
```
```
The wobbly material of an ochre jelly is not as potent as other oozes. Indeed, it is
weak enough that it can be treated with large amounts of other ingredients and
consumed safely. It is not actually uncommon to stumble upon a tribe of kobolds
that have set themselves up in a dungeon and farm the local ochre jellies in order to
brew a rather noxious ale.

### Orcs

_“As much as it pains me to admit this, I owe some of my sizeable knowledge to the orcs. Although they seem barbaric and
savage to us civilised folk, orcs are extraordinarily good hunters and harvesters. Generations spent roving the land has taught
them how to harvest just about anything, and I have learned some of my more esoteric techniques while observing their
methods.”_ - Hamund

Use: When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10

DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
5 Otyugh
Bile (vial)
```
```
As disgusting as the idea may sound, otyugh bile, capable of digesting just about
anything, actually makes for a very good medicine for indigestion. A common

mixed with a spoonful of honey (mostly to mask the taste).

Saliva

An otyugh's saliva is not actually poisonous, but it is loaded with so much bacteria
and disease that it may as well be.
Use: This saliva can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing
ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1
minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is
cured. For every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw,
reducing its hit point maximum by 1d10 on a failure. The disease is cured on a
success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This
reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

Ask anybody who has once tried to hide from an owlbear, and they will tell you of
how futile that effort is. Their keen eyesight, hearing, and sense of smell, combined
with their eerie owl-like tendency to twist their heads behind them while tracking,
make them a terrifying predator to elude. A scarf made from a part of their carcass
also grants some level of these senses, giving its owner some level of heightened
awareness.

Pure white, majestic, and incredibly durable, the hair of a pegasus is coveted as a

2 gp 3 lb.

10 Pegasus
Hoof

The hooves of a pegasus can be ground down and rendered into a glue like a
regular horse's. This glue however has a certain glittery imperfection in it that is
actually enjoyed by noble ladies fond of extravagance. This glue has been
converted into various cosmetics or as a final flourish to an already decadent
gown.

The large horns of a peryton are considered quite striking for their strange black

decent price. There is also a rumour that a set of dice crafted from the horns of a
peryton are particularly easy to use in cheating. This is unsubstantiated, however.

The horrible smelling musk of a piercer, while unpleasent, is not debilitatingly so.
Ironically enough, this musk can undergo an alchemical process to be transformed
into a rather expensive perfume. Of course, those marketing it are usually reluctant to
tell their buyers what it is made out of.
```

Underdark societies including bowls, furniture, and various tools.

### Pixie

_“I once met a man that collected pixies the way that other men collect butterflies. Needless to say, he was a tad unstable, but
some of the research he did was used to write this entry, so it would be rather ungrateful of me to criticise him too harshly.”_ -
Hamund

```
DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
15 Pixie
Dust
(small
pouch)
```
```
The ubiquitous dust dropped by the wings of pixies. Incredibly magical, yet volatile, it
is virtually impossible for a non-pixie to determine what will happen when sprinkled
on a creature.
Use: As an action, you may sprinkle some pixie dust on a creature next to you. If
sprinkled on an unwilling creature, they may resist any resulting effect by succeeding
on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If sprinkled on a willing creature, or an unwilling
creature that failed their saving throw, roll 1d10 and consult the pixie dust effect table
for the result. If the result would involve a saving throw, the DC is 12. A small pouch
of pixie dust has enough dust in it for 3 uses.

10 Pseudodragon
Venom (vial)
```
```
The venom of a pseudodragon has a soporific effect that some alchemists
have actually used to create a draught to treat insomnia. Of course, in its pure
state, it can still be used as an effective tranquiliser.
Use: Can be used to coat 1 piece of slashing or piercing ammunition or one
slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes an action. The next
time that the coated ammunition or weapon successfully hits a creature, that
creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become
poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target falls
unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature
uses an action to shake it awake.

### Purple Worm

It is a simple fact of Underdark life that you need to have a purple worm ward if you
wish to have a long-term settlement. Ironically, these wards require the blood of a
purple worm in order to be created. In a way, though it is fitting that only a society
that can kill a purple worm can be protected from them. Natural selection at its
finest, as it were.

The incredibly corrosive bile of a purple worm is coveted by miners for being able to
literally eat through rocks that would otherwise take weeks of work to break through.
Just be careful when harvesting it, however, you don't want to be known as the fool
who was eaten by an already slain purple worm.
Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw a vial of purple
worm bile at a target within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack
against the target, treating the vial as an improvised object. On a hit, the target
suffers 5d6 acid damage.

Fur (small

```
Shaggy and coarse, it would not be immediately apparent that quaggoth fur
has much use as anything except as a trophy. The fur however has remarkable
insulation qualities, and while uncomfortable, can stuff a coat to keep an
adventurer warm in even the deepest and darkest Underdark tunnel.
```
```
1 gp 4 lb.

```
10 Quaggoth
Blood (3

```
```
Due to their horrible Underdark diets, quaggoths have developed several
enzymes and antibodies that make them immune to poisons. If used in an
alchemy recipe, it creates a potion of poison resistance.

The psionic energy of the Underdark occasionally causes mutations in the
susceptible quaggoth population, creating what is known as a thonot. Their
brains are noticably larger and capable of psionic feats themselves. When
eaten, these psionic abilities are temporarily bequeathed to the eater.
Use: You may spend an action to eat this brain. For the next hour, you may cast
the feather fall and mage hand spells at will without using a spell slot or
requiring any spell components.

### Rakshasa

_“I got on the wrong side of a rakshasa once. Blasted thing kept hounding me every so often, no matter how many times I drove

```
10 Rakshasa
Claw

The hatred and malice inherent in a rakshasa is embodied in their deformed
claws, capable of imparting a curse that spites any it strikes. When burned in an
occult ritual, the ashes can create a dye used in dark rituals to curse unwary
hoarders of magical items.
```
```
50 gp 3 lb. Curse of

```
15 Rakshasa
Heart

```
The rakshasa's tendency to kill and subsume the lives of its victims is almost

others' identities, and can be refashioned into an amulet that allows its wielder
to do the same.

### Revenant

```
DC Item Description ValueWeightCrafting
```
```
20 Imprint of
Vengeance
```
```
A revenant's body contains nothing of value that an ordinary corpse would not
already possess, and it is usually beyond the abilities of an average harvester to
seal away the vengeance fuelled soul of a revenant. However, with quick action
and some spirit paper, an imprint of the soul may be saved, allowing one to track
the creature that wronged the revenant so badly. Requires spirit paper.
Use: While holding this item, you constantly know the distance to and direction
of any creature against which the revenant seeks revenge, even if the creature is
on a different plane of existence. You become aware if the creature being tracked
dies. While holding this paper, the revenant is similarly also aware of your
distance and direction to them.

Larger than most humans (as many hapless adventurers find out far too late),

The feather of a roc contains magical properties that make it capable of lifting

retains this property after being removed from the roc's body.
Use: While holding this item, you may cast the jump spell on yourself at will.
This spell ends if you stop holding the feather.

of the organ about the size of a large basket. This is said to be the place
touched by the giant god Annam and is what gives the roc its gargantuan size.

The trademark tendrils of the roper are still just as useful after removal from their
body as before. Due to the roper's endless ability to reproduce these appendages,
some Underdark societies actually raise live ropers specifically to take their
tentacles as rope and crafting material. The resulting aesthetic of their ropework is
disturbing to say the least. If you want to use them for the creation of a whip
however, it requires a steady hand in order to not damage the fragile hairs that
give it its debiliating qualities.

```
Even though a rust monster may be considered a blacksmith's biggest nightmare,
their bile is considered a valuable commodity in their line of work. Strong enough
to break down rust and metal, careful usage of their bile can be used to restore old
weapons to new, and sometimes can be used to craft metal patterns that would be
impossible otherwise.
```
```
1 gp 1 lb.
```
```
10 Rust
Monster
Antenna
(x2)
```
```
Rust monsters have the simultaneously wondrous and aggravating ability to sense
any ferrous metal within 30 feet of it. This is a property of their antennae, which
can be repurposed into metal detectors for ordinary humanoids (their corrosive
abilities being neutralised in the process of course).
```
```
1 gp 12 lb. Metal
Detector
```
```
15 Rust
Monster
Dust
(large
bag)
```
```
Taking the carapace of a rust monster and grinding it down into a dust is an all too
common tactic for subterranean cultures. This dust continues to carry the corrosive
property of the rust monster, and can be used as either a defense neutralising
weapon, or as a cruel practical joke.
Use: As an action you may toss a handful of rust monster dust at a ferrous non-
magical metal item within 5 feet. Upon contact, the dust corrodes and destroys a 1-
foot cube of the material. If the item is being worn or carried by a creature, that
creature may attempt a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid this effect. If the
object touched is a weapon or armour/shield, it suffers a permanent and cumulative
-1 penalty to damage rolls or AC offered respectively. If this penalty reaches -5 for a
weapon, drops a piece of armour's offered AC to 10, or drops a shield's AC bonus
to 0, then that item is destroyed. A single bag of rust monster dust has enough
dust to be used 5 times.

Occasionally, the shark god Sekolah chooses a female sahuagin to be one of their

priestesses can be identified by a marking on the priestesses skin that resembles
the bite pattern of a full grown shark. This skin can be used as a short-term charm
to copy the shark taming ability of a sahuagin.
Use: As an action you may raise this blessing in front of you. Any shark within 120
feet of you that can see you instantly becomes friendly towards you and obeys any
command you issue to it, so long as that command does not conflict with that of a
real sahuagin. 24 hours after being removed from its original body, this blessing
deteriorates and becomes useless.

Shadows barely have a corporeal form, and any that could be considered such is
quickly dispersed once their animating force has been defeated. Some of it can be
trapped inside a sheet of spirit paper, however, to be used to vex the unwary. Requires
spirit paper.
Use: If this item is left in the shadow of an incapacitated creature for at least 10
minutes, that creature's Strength score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this
reduces its Strength to 0. This effect lasts until the spell lesser restoration or similar
magic is used to remove this effect. If a non-evil humanoid dies while suffering from
this effect, a new shadow rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later. Once this item has
been used once, it loses all magical properties.

### Shambling Mound

_“Some scholars have attempted to study the lightning birth of shambling mounds, believing that their incredible regeneration_

_and growth abilities may be used to increase food production several times. Unfortunately, so far the only results of their
experiments have been electrified fields and irate farmers.”_ - Hamund

Due to their large sizes and amorphous nature, a shambling mound can potentially be harvested several times. If you

successfully harvest the “shambling mound mulch” or the “shambling mound vine” items, you may attempt to harvest them
again, with the DC raising by 2 for each attempt. You may repeatedly attempt to harvest either of these items until the first
time you fail on your harvesting check for them.

same lightning absorbing abilities.

gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If you choose not to,

unreliable, power.
Use: This claw may be used as an arcane focus. If you do so, when a creature you can
see is forced to roll a saving throw due to a spell you cast, you may force that creature
to roll at disadvantage. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use
this feature again. Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have
you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player's Handbook immediately after you
cast a spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this ability.

```
15 Specter
Remnant
(regular

A specter is a being of pure spite and malice, a soul severed from the cycle of
death and afterlife. When their form is dispersed, fragments of their soul can be
imprinted on spirit paper. These fragments radiate with as much hate as their
original complete form, and prolonged exposure to it can result in terrible
psychological damage. Requires spirit paper.
Use: A creature that spends at least 6 hours a day within 30 feet of this item for
7 continuous days becomes cursed. While cursed in this way, the creature has
disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
sight while in sunlight. In addition, their dreams become wracked with
nightmares and they gain no benefit from a long rest. If the cursed target sleeps
within 30 feet of this item, they must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving
throw or have their hit point maximum reduced by 3d6 points. The target dies if
this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Only one creature may be cursed
by this item at a time, and if a creature cursed by this item manages to remove
their curse by any means, this item becomes useless and crumbles into dust.

a poltergeist's dispersal, a sheet of spirit paper can capture some of this errant
energy to be used later for one's own mayhem and mischief. Requires spirit paper.
Use: As an action, this paper may be attached to a target Medium or smaller
creature or a target unattended object that weighs less than or equal to 150
pounds. Upon speaking a chosen command word or after a designated amount of
time, the creature or object that this paper is attached to is hurled 30 feet in the
direction away from the paper. If the paper is attached to a creature, they may roll
a DC 13 Strength saving throw to avoid this forced movement. If the hurled
target comes into contact with a hard surface or heavy object, the target takes
1d6 damage per 10 feet moved. This item may be used up to 3 times before it
runs out of energy and become useless.

fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the user of the dust also knows the

the saving throw.

## Harvest Table: T

_“So powerful is the tarrasque; so awe inspiring, devastating, and unstoppable, that every single part of it has entered the lore
of one culture or another. The tarrasque is in fact one of the few creatures in this Multiverse that I cannot boast about killing,
and in truth, even I would not attempt to. The entries here on tarrasque parts are based purely on legends I have heard on my_

_travels; ancient cultures that have inherited stories from even more ancient cultures. I shudder to know of which prehistoric
society ever managed to fell a tarrasque and harvest it for their own use, and I shudder even more to know what force
managed to wipe that society from the history books.”_ - Hamund

The tarrasque is so large that it cannot be easily harvested by any single adventurer, or indeed even a group of adventurers.
The harvesting of a tarrasque for usable parts is an endeavour that would require a full company of workers a long period of
time to complete, and that’s before the time it takes to ship everything back and then make the parts usable.

The harvesting of a tarrasque takes 10 labourers proficient in harvesting a total of 30 days to complete (assuming that they
work for 8 hours a day). Every 6 days, the labourers successfully manage to harvest 1 of the items on the tarrasque’s harvest
table. Due to the irregular method of harvesting a tarrasque, no check is made when attempting to do so, the labourers must
simply put in enough work to finish the job.

Tarrasque parts do not face deterioration regardless of length spent exposed to the elements, nor any lack of preservation.
Even nature itself does not wish to oppose a tarrasque.

N/ATarrasque
Heart
```
```
The dusty temple walls of some forgotten societies often depict what some
believe to be a tarrasque heart. The heart seems to be placed in a position of
reverence, the shadow of a tarrasque acting as a guardian for the city.
Use: Activating a tarrasque heart requires the work of 10 spellcasters who have
access to at least one 6th level spell slot or higher. Each spellcaster must spend
10 hours in constant contact and focus on the tarrasque heart. At the end of the
10 hours, they each expend a 6th level spell slot or higher. This process must be
repeated for 30 consecutive days, after which, the heart will activate and create
a protective enchantment in a dome centered on itself and with a radius of 3
miles. While they are alive and inside the protective enchantment, the
spellcasters that activated the heart may choose to spend an action to target any
number of creatures inside the protective enchantment and force them to
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened, with the
entire area under the protective enchantment considered the source of the
effect. While frightened in this way, a creature drops anything they are carrying
and must use their full movement as well as any potential dash actions to run as

repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if they

A tarrasque shell is the hardest substance known to man, harder than even the
legendary mithral and adamantine. As such, it is virtually impossible to chip off
any shards to be used as personal shields or armour, and may only be used in its
entirety. Modern scholars believe that the fabled elven ship, 'Skellbladnir' was
actually crafted from the shell of a tarrasque, explaining many of its purported
magical properties.

A tarrasque horn is said to make a battering ram powerful enough to breach the
gates of Hades itself and free all evil that dwell within. While that remains to be
tested, it is certainly strong enough to break down any structure made by
mortals. Even today, horn fragments are always found in the same kind of place:
the destroyed gates of an abandoned city.
Use: The tarrasque horn may be used as a ram (Dungeon Master's Guide, Page
255 ). This ram has a +14 to hit and deals 55 (10d10) bludegoning damage and
deals double damage against objects and structures.

The eyes of a tarrasque have witnessed countless civilisations lost to the annals

even though the tarrasque probably could not understand the majesty of what it
was seeing, it still bore witness to them, and combined with its powerful
inherent magic, that is enough for diviners to draw out the most ancient of
secrets.
Use: A creature casting the spell legend lore may instead choose to use the
tarrasque eye instead of the spell's usual components. This does not consume
the eye.

Tarrasque blood flows in the deepest crimson, and every ounce of it is steeped in

drawn with a tarrasque's blood are capable of casting rituals powerful enough to
challenge the gods themselves.

Uncovered histories of destroyed civilisations speak of an ancient tribal nation of

If the pictographs are understood correctly, the source of their ferocity came
from the flesh of a tarrasque that they consumed before every battle. Where they
got the strength to take down a tarrasque in the first place is another mystery
entirely.
Use: If a creature consumes 1 pound of tarrasque flesh, they gain a Strength score
of 30 for the next 24 hours. At the end of this period, that creature must succeed
on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer 4 points of exhaustion as their

Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or

will regenerate a quarter pound of flesh every 24 hours. If you eat 3 pounds of troll
flesh within a time frame of 7 days, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution

## Harvest Table: V

### Vampires

_“I have never been a fan of tussling with vampires. Creatures of the night, they rarely present an honest fight, not to mention
the annoying fact that most items harvested from their long-overdue corpses whisper temptations to those that possess them.
When I go monster hunting, I am looking for trophies, not gossipy boarders.”_ -Hamund

Items crafted or taken from a vampire carry with them a dark undead energy that makes using them a risky proposition.
Anytime a creature attuned to an item made from a vampire part attempts a long rest, there is a 10 percent chance that they
will be afflicted with the _Gravemaster’s Curse_. At the DM’s discretion, this roll may be made in secret, with the result unknown

to the relevant player.

A creature cursed in this way can’t voluntarily end their attunement to the item that cursed them, and they feel a need to be
within arm’s length of that item at all times. Whenever the cursed creature sleeps, they hear whispers of temptation from the

vampire from whom the cursed item was made but forgets it as soon as they awaken. A cursed creature is not necessarily
aware they have been cursed. After 7 consecutive days of being cursed, a cursed creature will take any opportunity to be alone
and to get away from anybody that would be able to identify and remove the curse.

If a creature remains cursed by this item for the continuous length of one full lunar cycle, they are possessed by the soul of the
vampire from whom the item that cursed them was created. When this happens, the creature is incapacitated and loses
control of their body which also transforms into a full vampire. The possessing vampire spirit retains all of their old memories,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as any spellcasting abilities it may have had. It otherwise adopts the

possessed target’s statistics, as well as any of their knowledge, class features, and proficiencies. The returned vampire also
retains attunement to any items the original possessed target had, including the item that cursed them in the first place.

The original soul of the possessed body is then imprisoned inside the item that cursed them. While imprisoned in this way, the

original soul is aware of its immediate surroundings and can communicate telepathically with any creature in contact with
them and vice versa. If the item is ever destroyed, the possessed soul is destroyed as well. The only way to lift the curse and
restore the soul to its body is with either a wish spell, or if the possessing vampire breaks their attunement to the cursing item.
If the curse is lifted in this way, the soul of the vampire is destroyed permanently and the original soul retakes control of their
body. If the original body is destroyed, the original soul is sent to the afterlife.

Only one item made from a vampire can curse a target at any given time and a creature may only be cursed by one vampire’s
item at a time. While cursed, any attempt to attune to an item made from another vampire fails. A creature that has had this
curse lifted from them may not attune to any other item made from a vampire again.

The necrotic blood of a vampire, as dark and thick as blood can possibly become.
While it may be foul, it does present one of the last hopes to cure the vampirism
of a loved one. It is unfortunate however that such little amounts may be drawn
from a slain vampire; it could be seen perhaps as a final taunt from the undead
fiends.
Use: A vial of vampire blood that has had the bless spell cast on it at least once a
day for 7 consecutive days becomes a vampire bane potion. If this potion is drunk
by a vampire spawn that was transformed by the vampire this potion was made
from, that vampire spawn is completely cured of vampirism, reverting to their

have turned to evil in its undeath, the heart can still do good by being used to
combat its dark master.
Use: A vampire spawn heart that has had the spell remove curse cast on it once a
day for 7 consecutive days, resonates with an energy counter to the darkness that
once pervaded it. In this condition, a vampire spawn heart will attempt to warn
anyone holding it of the approach of its old master. It will begin to beat slowly if the
original vampire is within 300 feet of the holder, and beat progressively faster as the

Yetis are capable of surviving in the darkest, coldest winters in part
largely to their thick hides and coats. In the desperate struggle that are
mountain peaks, these coats are worth more than their weight in gold,
and any mountain chief would happily welcome a stranger into their
hut when presented with a gift of yeti hide.

ancient icicles to make a brew that can preserve a creature in ice for an

It is more than just a superstition that the howl of a yeti brings a

These larger specimens breathe the cold itself, using it to weaken large
groups of unwary mountaineers before moving in for the final kill.
Use: You may spend an action to press these lungs and exhale a 30-
foot cone of frigid air. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18
Constitution saving throw, taking 10d8 cold damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this item has been
used, it cannot be used again and becomes worthless.

one's blood transfigured into fire."
Use: Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition
or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For
the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half

The heart of a yuan-ti abomination is one that has been specially blessed by
the serpent gods the yuan-ti worship. Locked inside this heart is incredible
divine power, but as befitting of the twisted worship the serpent gods
demand, it can be passed on only through its consumption.
Use: You may spend an action to eat this heart. When you do, you transform
into a yuan-ti abomination, as described in the Monster Manual, for the next
hour. Your alignment remains the same and you retain any proficiencies you
may have had originally. You do not get access to the weapons described in
the yuan-ti abomination's statblock. At the end of the hour, or if you are
forced prematurely back into your true form, there is a 10 per cent chance
that instead of transforming back to your original form, you transform into a
form resembling that of a Type 1 yuan-ti malison with a humanoid body but
with a snake head. This effect is permanent and is considered your new true
form. This effect can only be reversed with the power of a wish spell.

### Yugoloth

_“Unlike most fiends, the ichor that a yugoloth leaves behind actually serves some purpose. As befitting their greedy natures,
some lower-tier yugoloths have actually made a business of allowing themselves to be slain and their ichor collected.”_ -
Hamund

Like regular devils, yugoloths slain outside of their native plane also dissolve into an ichor rather than leave behind a corpse.
Given the yugoloths artificial nature however, this ichor tends to be more useful than devil ichor and can be harvested for
some benefit. Either way, a yugoloth slain outside of Gehaena cannot be harvested for anything except their respective ichor.
Yugoloths slain on Gehenna can be harvested like a regular creature, including their ichor, traces of which can still be found in

their veins.

##### Arcanaloth

```
DC Item Description ValueWeight Crafting
5 Arcanaloth
Ichor (vial)
```
```
The ichor of an arcanaloth is the most valuable of all yugoloth ichors, being
steeped in the knowledge and magic of the original arcanaloth. Requires
enchanted vial.
Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this
ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. When you begin
writing with this ink, you subconcsiously write down a spell that was known
to the arcanaloth. After 2 hours of writing with this ink, you may pick any
wizard spell from the arcanaloth's known spell list that is of a level for which
you have spell slots, and add it to your spellbook as if you had copied it in a
traditional manner.
```
```
100
gp
```
```
1 lb.
```
```
10 Arcanaloth
Poison
(vial)
```
```
Despite their learned and sophisticated nature, an arcanaloth is more than
capable of killing a mortal in close combat as they are using their spells. This
is partly in thanks to the poison glands they possess under their claws, which
add a touch of death to their razor sharp strikes.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition
or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For
the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 14
Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half
that on a successful saving throw.
```
```
300
gp
```
```
1 lb.
```
```
15 Arcanaloth
Tail
```
```
The tricky arcanaloth has a tendency to sneak into places it does not belong,
aided by its inherent ability to shapeshift and turn invisible. Part of this magic
is kept in their tail, which can be spotted twitching before they use any of
their deceptive abilitites.
Use: This tail has 3 charges. While holding this tail you may spend 1 charge
to use the tail to cast the spell alter self or invisibility (self only). Once this
tail loses all charges, it dissolves into a useless black ichor.

Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim.

##### Mezzoloth

```
DC Item Description ValueWeight Crafting
```
```
5 Mezzoloth
Ichor (vial)
```
```
The ichor of a mezzoloth appears even more foul and dark than that of other
yugoloths (if that is even possible). Like many yugoloth ichors, this ichor can
be mixed with precious gem dust and oils to make an ink that passes on
powerful magics. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this
ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. If you are able to
prepare a spell of at least 5th level, when you begin writing with this ink you
subconcsiously write down the information regarding the spell cloudkill. You
may do this for a total of 10 hours, after which you successfully copy the
spell into your wizard spellbook as if you had copied it from a regular source.
```
```
50
gp
```
```
1 lb.
```
```
10 Mezzoloth
Gas (vial)
```
```
The gas of a mezzoloth is extraordinarily toxic and is said to have been the
inspiration to whichever wizard invented the spell cloudkill. It will remain
potent so long as it is kept in an enchanted vial, however it will dissipate
much faster than a sample that came fresh from a living mezzoloth. Requires
enchanted vial.
Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at
a point within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Once the vial is destroyed, the
trapped gas expands rapidly to fill a 10 foot radius sphere. The gas acts like
the spell cloudkill with the exception that it only lasts for 1 round and
requires no creature's concentration to maintain it.

##### Nycaloth

```
DC Item Description ValueWeight Crafting
```
```
5 Nycaloth
Ichor
(vial)
```
```
Nycoloth ichor is thicker and stickier than other yugoloth ichor and has a
vague green tinge to it. This is odd considering that the magic it lends itself to
points towards a more slippery nature. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor
becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. If you are able to prepare
a spell of at least 2nd level, when you begin writing with this ink you
subconcsiously write down the information regarding the spell mirror image.
You may do this for a total of 4 hours, after which you successfully copy the
spell into your wizard spellbook as if you had copied it from a regular source.
```
```
70
gp
```
```
1 lb.
```
```
10 Nycaloth
Claw
(x2)
```
```
The claw of a nycaloth actually has dozens of tiny hook-like forms growing on
the insides. These hooks cause massive damage when the claws rend
unprotected flesh, making wounds worse with each progressive attack. While
it may be considered vicious, the same principle can be applied to other
weapons to give them the same combative edge.

```
55

Like many fiends, the wings of a nycaloth can be used as a base component to
make the ever useful infernal wings. Their high quality makes them particulalry
useful as a material, meaning the artificer has to put relatively little effort (and
money) into making them.

##### Ultraloth

```
DC Item Description ValueWeight Crafting
```
```
5 Ultraloth
Ichor
(vial)
```
```
The ichor of an ultraloth is almost as valuable as that of the yugoloth, full of
the inherent magic of the ultraloth. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor
becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. When you begin writing
with this ink, you subconcsiously write down a spell that was known to the
ultraloth. After 2 hours of writing with this ink, you may pick any wizard spell
from the ultraloth's known spell list that is of a level for which you have spell
slots, and add it to your spellbook as if you had copied it in a traditional
manner.
```
```
100
gp
```
```
1 lb.
```
```
10 Mark of
Gehenna
```
```
Other than their general form, every ultraloth carries some mark on their
person that brands them as a general above lesser yugoloths, an individual to
be respected and feared. This brand is more than an ordinary mark and carries a
degree of magic to it that affects the wills of lesser beings even if they
themselves are unaware of it.
Use: While carrying this mark on you, you may choose to gain advantage on
any Charisma based ability check attempted on a creature within 30 feet of
you that has a CR rating less than that of your character level. That creature
does not need to be aware of the mark, but must be able to hear and
understand you for this effect to work. Once used, this ability cannot be used
again until the next dawn.

## Chapter 4: Crafting

# I

_t was our long distant ancestors that first
discovered how to transform the bones of a fresh
kill into a heavy club with which to make more
fresh kills. Today of course, we have the wonders of
civilisation, and with that comes a litany of more
advanced tools, weapons, armour, and equipment
to be made from what we kill. Indeed, the
resourcefulness of society means that just about every_

_creature’s carcass can serve as more than just a trophy if
you take it to someone with the right know-how._ -Hamund

### Crafting Rules

While some creature parts are useful fresh from the
carcass, many require some alterations before their full
potential can be realised. These items can be identified due
to having a **craftable item** listed in their crafting column.

As crafting is a very natural complement to harvesting, an
entire chapter has been devoted to its rules here.

#### Crafters

In order to craft a harvested item into a usable item, it must
be worked on by a skilled **crafter**. Crafters are specialised
professionals with the knowledge to turn raw materials
into something usable. Crafters also tend to be of a certain

type, covering different types of items to be made (see
“Crafter Types” below).
Both player characters and NPCs may act as crafters, so
long as they fulfil the stipulated requirements for their
crafter type.

Crafters also need to have the right equipment and tools
in order to craft an item, however that aspect is left up to
the discretion of the DM and the suitability of the setting. In
more fantastical campaigns, magical forges and

laboratories may line every city bazaar, while in more
grounded settings, finding appropriate facilities may be a
quest in and of itself.

#### Materials, Time, and Cost

Each craftable item listed in this guide requires at least one
harvestable material from a monster’s harvesting table to
act as a **base component** of the item. This base component
provides the driving magical force that allows the item to

function. The harvesting material and quantity of the
materials required are listed in the description of the
craftable item. For some craftable items, there are several
potential harvestable materials that may act as the base

component. In these cases, any of the listed materials may
be used.
Craftable items require more than just the base
component provided by harvested materials, however.

Crafting an item requires a cost covering other
requirements such as tools, facilities, and extra materials.
Note that this cost does NOT include the cost of actually
hiring a crafter, and that such a cost is considered separate.
Assuming that the players are providing the base

component for a craftable material, the value of this base
component can be deducted from the end cost of crafting
the item.
Finally, craftable items take a certain amount of time

before they can be completed. The breakdown of the time
and cost investment to craft an item is listed in the Magic
Item Crafting Time and Cost table on the next page.

###### Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost

```
Item Rarity Workweeks* Cost*
Common 1 50 gp
```
```
Uncommon 2 200 gp
```
```
Rare 10 2,000 gp
Very Rare 25 20,000 gp
```
```
Legendary 50 100,000 gp
```
```
*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll.
```
```
This guide uses the rules for crafting in Xanathar’s Guide
to Everything as the basis for the crafting rules presented
here. DM’s are encouraged to adjust these numbers based
on the needs of their own games.
```
##### Optional Rule: Crafter Skill

```
Not all crafters are created equal. While a village
blacksmith may be good at fixing scythes and making nails,
if you hand them a dragon scale, the best you will get back
is a ruined dragon scale and an apologetic look. If you have
high quality materials, you're going to need a high quality
crafter.
While under the base rules, anyone can craft anything so
long as they meet the base proficiency requirements, under
this optional rule, crafters are differentiated based on their
proficiency bonus. A crafter may craft any item whose rarity
is equal to or below their proficiency bonus as outlined in
the Crafting Skill Proficiency table on the next page.
```
#### Crafter Type

```
You don’t ask a blacksmith to cut the timbers of your house,
and you don’t ask an alchemist to craft you a suit of armour.
If you want an item crafted, you need the right person for
the job. Each craftable item comes with a tag in brackets
explaining which type of crafter is capable of making that
item.
Crafters are not restricted to a single profession either.
Some skills are complimentary, or certain individuals are
simply talented enough to cover multiple fields. Unless
otherwise stated, crafters with multiple proficiencies use
the same score for each field.
The following is a basic rundown of crafter types:
```

###### Optional Rule: Crafting Skill Proficiency

```
Prof.Skill Level Item Rarity Description
```
```
+2 Novice Common Usually an apprentice, assistant, or self-taught practitioner. Knows how to use the tools
properly but has little skill with more difficult materials and no ability to make new ideas.
```
```
+3 JourneymanUncommonA craftsmen that serves their village or works in a specific role within their profession.
Knows a few things very well, but most likely would not be able to understand the
complexities of more exotic materials.
+4 Artisan Rare The highest level of skill that most ordinary people could hope to attain. Capable of
establishing a good trade in a city or in service of a noble. Experienced in almost all
aspects of their profession and can work with some confidence on rarer materials.
```
```
+5 Master Very Rare While hard work and dedication is always valuable, only a few people possess the
inherent talent to push the limits of their craft farther than ordinary people. These
talented individuals can be considered masters of their art; capable of not just
reproduction, but innovation.
```
```
+6 Grand
Master
```
```
Legendary An absolute master of their art. Most likely was either an adventurer in their past, or
learned their trade from a supernatural force, as this would be the only way for them to
become accustomed to the legendary materials that they work with. Capable of crafting
any item that falls under their profession.
```
##### Alchemist

Alchemy is a profession that deals with the brewing and

mixing of potions, concoctions, and tinctures. In general, if
an organic material needs to be crushed, powdered, dried,
boiled, melted, burned, mixed, etc., it's a job for an
alchemist.
As part of their job, alchemists must also be experienced

herbalists and have some knowledge of creature parts, but
this level of knowledge may vary wildly from alchemist to
alchemist. For example, village alchemists may know how
to mix up local herbs with dried animal parts to cure a cold,

while an elvish grandmaster may have learned the 12
secret uses of dragon blood.
Any character that has proficiency with alchemy tools
may be considered an alchemist for crafting purposes.

##### Artificer

A catch-all term for anyone who works primarily in the
moulding, transfiguration, enchanting, and manufacture of

magical items. Often powerful wizards, their job requires
them to not only understand magic, but alse be able to
weave permanent spells to transform mundane objects into
wondrous ones. A common practice among artificers

working with harvested materials is to transfigure them
into gems and other objects more conducive to humanoid
wear.
As part of their job, an artificer would have knowledge of

the uses of magical creature parts, spellwork, the use and
preparation of magical reagents (crushed gems, incense,
etc), magical identification, magical history, and basic metal
and woodworking. Of course, not all artificers have the
same level of skill. Some may spend their entire lives mass

manufacturing the same magical trinkets day in and day
out, while others have ventured to far planes and learned
ancient lessons in the courts of djinni princes.
Any character that is proficient in the Arcana skill and

has access to at least one spell slot may be considered an
artificer for crafting purposes.

##### Blacksmith

```
A hammer striking anvil, the roar of a heated forge, and the
hiss of cooling metal. These are the sounds of a
blacksmith’s shop, the masters and crafters of metal. While
the job of a blacksmith is usually simplified to a
“metalworker,” the role encompasses so much more.
Blacksmiths craft and fix all manners of equipment ranging
from farming equipment, to weapons, to suits of armour.
Not only that, but while blacksmiths normally deal strictly
with metal, many creature shells, bones, and scales require
metal reinforcement and/or attachments before they can be
used as weapons and armour. As such, even though they
are organic materials, it is still primarily a blacksmith’s
responsibility to craft with them.
Blacksmith skills can vary wildly. The local blacksmith
may only have a small forge from where they repair the
hammers and scythes of their neighbours, while the master
smiths of dwarven kingdoms smelt adamantium in rivers of
magma at the heart of volcanoes.
Any character that is proficient in the smith’s tools may
be considered a blacksmith for crafting purposes.
```
##### Leatherworker

```
Metal armour doesn’t agree with everyone, and many
creatures have perfectly good hides that they won’t be using
anymore. For times like these, a leatherworker is required.
It is a long and messy job to take raw hides, tan them,
preserve them, cut them, and fashion them into armour
and other equipment, but most societies would break down
without this crucial industry.
While leatherworkers are often looked down upon for
their unpleasant job, these are usually just the
leatherworkers that deal with mundane animal hides and
skins. Highly skilled leatherworkers however are treated
with the utmost respect since without them, your skinned
Purple Worm hides would go completely to waste.
Any character that is proficient in the leatherworker’s
tools may be considered a leatherworker for crafting
purposes.

##### Tinker

Tinkers are a rare profession, but their work possesses
incredible value. Tinkers are usually associated with
finnicky contraptions and devices, and if they ever use

magic it is usually more of an energy source rather than the
driving characteristic. Really, tinkers are more concerned
with finding new materials with strange properties to
experiment with, and their inventions can range from the
entertaining to the absolutely revolutionary.

With that in mind, tinkers vary widely in skill. A travelling
peddler may have some experience in making mechanical
puppets that flail around for the amusement of children,
while the daring few that have travelled to Mechanus and

returned alive may have unlocked the secrets of artificial
life.
Any character that is proficient in the tinker’s tools may
be considered a tinker for crafting purposes.

##### Thaumaturge

When a piece of armour needs the blessings of a god, or a
sword needs a spirit coaxed into it, a thaumaturge is

needed. These specialised crafters usually do not consider
themselves crafters at all, but simply people with special
connections to the gods and their divine energy.
Thaumaturges are not limited to just those that worship

the gods either, many fiendish cults can boast their own
specialised thaumaturge members that craft their cursed
daggers and bind damned souls into pieces of jewellery.

```
As strange as it is to say, the gods do not see everyone as
equals, and certainly do not apportion their gifts
impartially. A vagrant holy man is probably capable of
invoking his god’s name to create a few vials of holy water,
while a high cleric of Moradin would be able to bless a
hammer so that it strikes with the same fury as their
furious deity.
Any character that is proficient in the Religion skill has
access to at least one spell slot, and is a follower of a deity
or otherworldly patron, may be considered a thaumaturge
for crafting purposes.

#### Crafting Items from Published

#### Books

```
Some craftable items originate from official source books
published by Wizards of the Coast. In order to avoid lifting
large sections of their book and reproducing them here,
you are encouraged to look them up in their original books.
The source book has been tagged next to the craftable
item’s name: DMG for Dungeon Master’s Guide, and XGTE
for Xanathar’s Guide to Everything.
In order to understand the quantities of harvestable

## Craftable Items A-Z

# C

```
raftable items are presented in alphabetical
order. A craftable item's description gives the
item's name, its category, its rarity, its base
component, the crafter type required to make
it, and its magical properties.
```
##### Aboleth Amulet

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

_Crafted by: Aboleth Brain x1 (Artificer)_
This pale turquoise amulet seems to have a faint flicker of
something moving in it, like seeing a creature in murky
waters. While wearing this amulet, you gain telepathy out

to a range of 120 ft., can understand and speak Deep
Speech, and become proficient in Intelligence (History)
checks if you weren’t proficient already.
You may also spend an action to target one creature you

can see within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on
a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by
you. This charm persists until either you or the target dies,
or if you are on different planes of existence. You and the

charmed target may communicate with each other
telepathically over any distance so long as you are wearing
and attuned to this item.
You may only have up to 3 targets charmed in this way at

a time. If you successfully charm another target while you
already have 3 targets charmed, the charm effect ends on
the creature that you charmed first. Whenever the charmed
target takes damage, they may repeat the saving throw. On
a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24

hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it
is at least 1 mile away from you. If a creature succeeds on
either resisting the charm effect or if the charm effect on
them ends, they become immune to this ability for the next

24 hours.

##### Amulet of Secrets

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

_Crafted by: Sphinx Heart x1 (Artificer)_
This blood red amulet is set inside a gold frame the colour
of desert sand. While wearing and attuned to this amulet,
you gain an uncanny ability to disguise your thoughts and

emotions. You become immune to any effect that would
sense your emotions or read your thoughts, as well as any
divination spell that you refuse. Wisdom (Insight) checks
made to ascertain your intentions or sincerity have

disadvantage.
In addition, you may use the amulet to cast the spell _zone
of truth_ without using a spell slot or requiring any
components. The DC for the casting of this spell in this way

is 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus,
and you are exempt from the effects of the spell. Once you
have used this ability 3 times in one day, you may not use it
again until you finish a long rest.

##### Amulet of Maglubiyet

```
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Mark of Maglubiyet x1 (Thaumaturge)
While wearing this amulet, you gain the ability to spend
your action and martial your allies with your resounding
leadership. For 1 minute, you may utter a special command
or warning whenever a non-hostile creature that you can
see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving
throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can
hear and understand you. A creature can benefit from only
one of these effects at a time. This effect ends early if you
are incapacitated.
```
##### Amulet of the Desert Tyrant

```
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Mummy Lord Heart x1 (Artificer)
This item has 9 charges. While wearing this amulet you
may spend an action and 1 or more charges to do any of the
following:
```
```
You may use the item to cast any of the following spells:
spiritual weapon (2 charges, plus 1 additional charge for
every level cast above 2nd), animate dead (3 charges
plus 1 additional charge for every level cast above 3rd),
guardian of faith (4 charges), insect plague (5 charges,
plus 1 additional charge for every level cast above 5th),
or harm (6 charges).
You create a cloud of blinding dust and sand around
yourself. Each creature within 5 feet of you must
succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be
blinded until the end of their next turn (2 charges).
You transform yourself into a whirlwind of sand and
immediately move up to 60 feet and then revert to
normal form. While in whirlwind form, you are immune
to all damage, and you can’t be grappled, petrified,
knocked prone, restrained or stunned. Equipment worn
or carried by you remain in your possession (2 charges).
```
```
If you die while wearing this amulet, and if this amulet
has at least 7 charges in it, the amulet will automatically
expend 7 charges to create a new body for your soul to
inhabit. This body is formed from dust in a space within 5
feet of the amulet over the course of 24 hours, upon which
the amulet can be placed on the new body, allowing your
soul to enter it and return to life. This new body is a
duplicate of your original one at the moment of its death
but with all wounds healed and all hit points restored. This
ability fails if the amulet is destroyed or removed from your
body during the 24 hours it is creating a new body.
This item regains 1d8+1 charges daily at dawn.
```
##### Amulet of the Mind Flayer

```
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Mind Flayer Heart x1 (Artificer)
While you are wearing this amulet, you may spend an
action to designate up to 4 willing creatures within 30 feet
of you as your thralls. So long as you and your thralls are
on the same plane of existence, you may communicate with
them telepathically.
```

In addition, so long as you and at least one of your thralls
are within 30 feet of each other, you both gain advantage on
Intelligence saving throws, and if you suffer psychic

damage, you may spend your reaction to force your thrall to
suffer some, or all of that damage instead of you. You may
only have up to 4 creatures as your thralls at a time. If you
wish to add a new creature, you must spend an action
breaking your connection to one of your old ones first.

**Curse:** Using this amulet is a dangerous proposition due
to its vile origins. Attuning to this amulet curses you until
you are targeted by the _remove curse_ spell or similar
magic. While cursed, you automatically fail on saving

throws imposed by members of the illithid race, including
elder brains and intellect devourers.

##### Amulet of the Ocean Lord

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Kraken Brain Stem x1 (Artificer)_
This item has 9 charges. While wearing this amulet, you
may spend an action and 1 or more charges to do any of the

following:

```
You may cast any of the following spells without
requiring any components or spell slots: conjure
elemental (1 charge, water elementals only), chain
lightning (1 charge), tsunami (2 charges), or control
weather (2 charges). These spells use your spell DC. If
you do not have one, the DC is equal to 8 + your
Intelligence modifier.
For the next hour, any aquatic creature within 6 miles of
you that has an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are
charmed by you and aggressive towards targets of your
choosing. These creatures understand verbal
commands you give them, and you telepathically
understand basic ideas and images from them while
they are within 30 feet of you (1 charge).
While you are submerged in water, you may emit a
magical pulse that allows you to sense the distance,
direction, and shape of any solid object and creature
that are both within 1 mile of you and within the same
body of water as you (1 charge).
```
```
This item regains 1d8 charges daily at dawn.
```
##### Amulet of the Trickster

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

_Crafted by: Rakshasa Heart x1 (Artificer)_
When you kill a humanoid while wearing this amulet, you
may spend your reaction to add an imprint of their identity
to it. At any time afterwards, you may spend your action to

polymorph yourself into any humanoid whose identity you
have imprinted into this amulet. You gain the statistics of
that creature, including their ability scores and any racial
features, but you do not gain any of their class features.

While polymorphed, you gain access to any memories that
humanoid had at the time of their death, and your
mannerisms and voice become indistinguishable to the real
humanoid. This polymorph lasts for 1 hour, until your drop

to 0 hit points or die, or if you end the effect early as an
action. If the effect ends as a result of dropping to 0 hit
points, any excess damage carries over to your normal
form.
This polymorph ability may only be used once per dawn

to polymorph into each identity you have imprinted. This
item loses any imprinted identities it had if attunement to it
is ever broken.

##### Angel Robe

```
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Deva Skin (Leatherworker)
You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this robe and all
your weapon attacks are considered magical. In addition,
you gain the ability to spend an action to polymorph
yourself into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge
rating equal to or lower than your character level, or back
into your true form. You revert to your true form if you die
or drop to 0 hit points. If the effect ends due to dropping to
0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your true
form. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is
absorbed or borne by the new form (your choice).
In a new form, you retain your statistics and ability to
speak, but your AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity,
and special senses are replaced by those of the new form,
and you gain any statistics and capabilities (except class
features, legendary action, and lair actions) that the new
form has but that you lack.
```
##### Anti-Magic Crystal

```
Wondrous item, very rare
Crafted by: Beholder Main Eye x1 (Artificer)
This roughly basket sized crystal radiates a field of energy
that disrupts the normal flow of the multiverse and
prevents magical forces from acting in its proximity. This
crystal creates an area of antimagic around itself, as in the
antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot radius. This field passes
through all solid objects except a layer of lead that is at
least 1 inch thick.
This crystal cannot be deactivated (including in other
antimagic fields) and only stops functioning if it is
destroyed. The crystal has 30 hit points, 15 AC and is
immune to poison and psychic damage.
```
##### Armour of the Guardian

```
Armour (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Shield Guardian Breastplate x1 (Blacksmith)
While wearing this armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You
also gain a special connection to the wearer of the amulet
that was connected to the shield guardian that provided the
breastplate to craft this armour. Whenever the wearer of
that amulet takes damage and is within 60 feet of you, half
of that damage (rounded up) is transferred to you.
In addition, whenever a creature makes an attack against
the wearer of the amulet, you may use your reaction to
grant a +2 bonus to the wearer’s AC if you are within 5 feet
of them.
```
##### Bag of Colding

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Ghast Hide x1 or Ghoul Hide x1 or Frost Giant
Tongue x1/4 (Leatherworker)
This bag has a permanent enchantment on it that causes
any organic material inside it to be kept in a state of
preservation as if it had the spell gentle repose cast upon it.
This effect wears off as soon as the item is removed from
the bag, and the bag must be completely closed in order for
its ability to function.
The bag is capable of holding up to 3 cubic feet of
material inside it and its opening can open up to 1 foot in
diameter.
```

##### Barbed Cloak

_Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Barded Hide x1 (Leatherworker)_
While you are wearing this cloak, you deal 1d10 piercing

damage to any creature grappling you at the start of your
turn.

##### Basilisk Gaze Poison

_Poison, uncommon_

_Crafted by: Basilisk Eye x1 (Alchemist)_
A creature that drinks this poison must succeed on a DC
12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24
hours. While poisoned in this way, a creature magically

turns to stone and is petrified. A creature remains petrified
like this until either the 24 hours have passed, or until freed
by the _greater restoration_ spell or similar magic.

##### Black Heart

_Wondrous item, very rare
Crafted by: Death Knight Heart x1 (Thaumaturge)_
This item has an intrinsic link with the death knight from

whom it was crafted. When held by a creature, it will beat
when faced in the direction of that death knight if that
death knight is still animate and on the same plane of
existence as the holder. The frequency and intensity of its

beats will also increase the closer it is to its death knight.

##### Blight Oil

_Oil, common_

_Crafted by: Blight Seed x5 (Alchemist)_
This bottle contains enough oil to cover up to 10 square
feet of surface area. Once this oil is rubbed into the surface
of vegetation, it will soak half a foot into it. Vegetation
soaked in this oil becomes as soft and malleable as wet clay

and retains any physical manipulation done to it.
The oil dries after 10 minutes, causing the vegetation it
was rubbed on to become solid again.

##### Blinders Helm

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Helmed Horror Helmet x1 (Artificer)_
While wearing this helmet, you gain a blindsight out to a

range of 60 feet, and are immune to the blinded, and
deafened conditions.

##### Bronze Companion

_Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Spark of Creation x1 (Tinker)_
This three-inch tall bronze statue is a perfect replica of any
beast. When the command word is spoken, the statue

comes to life and mimics the actions and behaviour of the
animal it is modelled after. It possesses no other traits of its
model animal, except flight which it can mimic up to a
speed of 10 ft.

This statue is friendly towards whoever spoke its
command word and obeys basic instructions given to it.
The statue can make small noises mimicking its model
animal and can carry a maximum weight of 1 pound.
If its command word is spoken again, the statue becomes

inert once more.

##### Camouflage Chitin

```
Armour, rare
Crafted by: Thri-Kreen Carapace x1 (Blacksmith)
This full chitin armour has an AC of 13 + Dexterity
modifier (max 2). While wearing this armour, you may
change its appearance to match the colour and texture of
your surroundings. If you do so, you gain advantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.
```
##### Canteen of Last Resort

```
Wondrous item, common
Crafted by: Ankheg Gaster x1 (Artificer)
This canteen resembles a gourd in the shape of an “8”, with
the bottom sphere smaller than the top, and with two
plugged openings on the top and bottom. When fertile soil
is left in the top sphere, the canteen slowly extracts usable
nutrients from it, which it filters into an edible slime in the
bottom sphere.
The top sphere is capable of holding up to 3 pounds of
fertile soil, which if left for at least 16 hours, produces
enough slime to provide the nutritional requirements of an
average humanoid for a day. This slime has a repugnant
taste and expires if not eaten within 24 hours.
```
##### Cape of Helping Hands

```
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Marilith Spine x1 (Leatherworker)
This leather cape is formed from two enchanted sheets of
leather, connected to a repurposed marilith spine running
down the centre.
While wearing this cape, you may speak the command
word as an action to animate the two sheets of leather
which detach from the spine and form an extra set of arms
and hands. You may control these arms and hands as if
they were your own free hands, and they have a reach,
strength, and dexterity equal to your regular arms and
hands. You do not gain any extra attacks, and the rules for
two-weapon fighting remain unchanged.
These extra hands remain for 1 hour or until you dismiss
them by repeating the command word as an action. When
they disappear, they cannot be used again for the next 1d6
hours.
```
##### Celestial Helm

```
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Solar Eye x2 (Artificer)
This helm has 9 charges and regains 1d8 charges at dawn.
While wearing this helm, you spend an action to expend 1
or more charges to do any of the following:
```
```
You, and any equipment you are wearing or carrying,
teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can
see. (1 charge)
You emit a magical, divine energy. Each creature of your
choice in a 10-foot radius centered on yourself must
make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire
damage plus 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or
half as much on a successful one. (1 charges)
You target one creature you can see within 30 feet. If the
target can see, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or be blinded until magic such as the
lesser restoration spell removes the blindness. (2
charges)
```

```
You release your held melee weapon to hover magically
in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you can
see the melee weapon, you can mentally command it as
a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and either make one
attack against a target or return to your hands. If the
hovering sword is targeted by any effect, you are
considered to be holding it. The hovering weapon falls if
you die or take off the helmet. Otherwise, this effect
lasts for 1 minute. This ability may only be used on one
melee weapon at a time, any attempt to use it on
another while one is already under its effect causes the
original one to fall to the ground. (2 charges)
```
##### Chain of Command

_Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Succubus/Incubus Tail x1 (Blacksmith)_

While holding this weapon, you may use this weapon to
make grapple checks instead of using a free hand. While
you have a creature grappled this way, you can't attack with
this weapon.

If you have a creature grappled by this weapon, you may
spend your action to force that creature to succeed on a DC
15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 24
hours. While charmed, the creature obeys your verbal or

telepathic commands to the best of its ability. If the
creature suffers any harm or receives a command that
would be hazardous to itself, it can repeat the saving throw,
ending the effect on a success. If the creature successfully

saves against this effect, or if the effect on it ends, it
becomes immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
You may only have one creature charmed at a time. If you
charm another, the effect on the previous creature ends.

##### Chain of Entanglement

_Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Living Chain x1 (Artificer)_
You may use this weapon instead of your free hand when

you make grapple checks. While you have a creature
grappled this way, you cannot make attacks with this
weapon.
Additionally, while holding this item, you may spend an

action to speak this item’s command word and throw it into
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. At this point, this
weapon becomes magically animate and may attack and
move freely for the next minute. As a bonus action on your

turn, you may either mentally command the chain to move
up to 20 feet in any direction or make an attack against a
target within 10 feet of it. At the end of the minute or if you
drop unconscious, the chain drops to the ground and this

ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
While animate, treat this weapon as if it had 14 Strength
and a +2 proficiency bonus for the sake of attack rolls,
damage rolls, and grapple checks.

##### Charming Knife

_Weapon (dagger), rare
Crafted by: Lamia Claw x1 (Blacksmith)_

As an action, you may speak this weapon’s command word
to activate its ability for the next minute. While this
dagger’s ability is active, any damage it deals to a creature
that is charmed by you does not count as damaging it or
doing anything harmful to it for the sake of potentially

ending the charm effect. Once this ability has been used
once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

##### Chest Burster

```
Poison, rare
Crafted by: Slaad Egg Gland x1 (Alchemist)
This insidious poison is riddled with tiny slaadi eggs, kept
preserved inside the noxious solution that serves as this
poison’s base. A creature that drinks a dose of this poison
must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be
infected with a disease – a miniscule slaad egg.
A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at
a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest
cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour
period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its
speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls,
ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole
chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's
chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.
If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence,
the unborn slaad is disintegrated. This item contains
enough poison for 3 doses.
```
##### Chimera Kite

```
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Chimera Dragon Wing x2 (Leatherworker)
This wondrous kite is normally kept folded up into a single
neat pole. You may spend 1 minute unfolding the kite into
its flight mode which possesses two great wings, a handle,
and a leather harness for the user to strap themselves into.
While in flight mode, a creature strapped into the harness
can speak the command word to cause the kite to emit a
magical burst of wind behind itself that propels it, and the
creature strapped into it, up to 80 feet in the direction that
it is facing. This ability may be used up to 3 times before
the kite runs out of magical energy. The kite regains 1 use
of this ability every 12 hours that it is not used.
While this kite is airborne and horizontal, it travels
forward at a rate of 30 feet per round and descends at a
rate of 10 feet per round. The user may change the
direction they are flying by pulling on the handle.
If the harness is strapped to something that is heavier
than 400 pounds, the harness will instead break when the
command word is spoken, and the kite will fly away.
```

##### Chimera Trident

_Weapon (trident), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Chimera Goat Head x1 + Chimera Lion Head
x1 + Chimera Dragon Head x1 (Blacksmith)_

This trident’s three horns are made of a chimera’s goat
horn, lion tooth, and dragon fang. This trident has three
abilities, each of which may be used upon a successful
melee weapon attack with this weapon.

```
You force the creature you hit to succeed on a DC 15
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
The next weapon attack by one of your allies that is
made against the creature you hit is made with

the mouth of any Medium or smaller creature that attempts

to insert it. These dentures automatically fill in any missing
teeth of that creature. If you have these dentures inserted,
you may spend an action to concentrate on them to give
them the appearance of other teeth such as buck teeth or
fangs, but no matter what form they take, these dentures

are no stronger than human teeth.
When left outside, these teeth chatter loudly for a few
seconds every 1d4 hours.

additional 30 feet.
Cast bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an

foot radius.
```
```
While holding the lamp, you may speak the command
```
word again as an action to change it to any of the other
lighting options, turn the lamp off, or to make it so that the
light emitted is only visible to the creature holding the
lamp. The fire inside this lamp never runs out of fuel and
can burn indefinitely in any environment in which fire is

wind for the next 24 hours. During this time, you
automatically succeed on any ability check to navigate a

##### Lycan Gas

```
Poison, rare
Crafted by: Lycanthrope Blood x1 (Alchemist)
This vial of silvery white gas reacts strongly with air and
expands to a 30-foot radius cloud as soon as the vial is
opened. Any creature that starts their turn in the cloud
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be cursed
with lycanthropy. The type of lycanthropy and the DC
depends on the type of lycan this gas was created from as
outlined in the table below.
The gas cloud remains for 1 minute before dispersing
naturally. It may be dispersed early by a strong wind such
as that created by the gust of wind spell.
```

extension. When a creature holds the handles, the pointing
extension moves until it is pointing at the nearest magical
object within 120 feet (itself excluded). This item will not
point at magical objects within 120 feet that are covered by
1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of
lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
```

_Wondrous item, common

(Survival) checks made to track the location of chimeras,
griffons, perytons, wyverns, and dragons (true dragons

##### Mask of Fear

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Chain Devil Eye x2 (Artificer)_
When a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you while you are wearing this mask, you can create the illusion that you look like one of the creature’s departed
loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see you, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be

frightened until the end of its turn.
Once you have used this ability once, it cannot be used
again until you finish a short rest.

##### Medusa Helm

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Medusa Head x1 (Blacksmith)_
This full helmet is magically fused with the head of a
medusa to recreate its petrifying gaze. While wearing this

helmet, you may spend your action to open or close the
visor; closing the visor causes the medusas visage to be
complete and activates this item’s ability. While this item’s
ability is active, any creature within 30 feet of you that you

can see and who can see you, must make a DC 14
Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or
more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a
creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is

restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving
throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a
failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification
lasts until the creature is freed by the _greater restoration_

spell or other magic.
The medusa’s visage only possesses enough magic to
allow its petrifying gaze ability to function for 1 minute.
Anytime this item is used, subtract the amount of time it is

used from this minute. Once this time has been expended,
this item loses its magical property. This item regains all
expended time upon the next dawn.

##### Medusa Whip

within 30 feet. When within 30 feet of ferrous metal, these
rods will vibrate slightly, with the vibrations becoming
more intense as they get closer to an item made of ferrous
material.
```
##### Mezzoloth Mail

```
Armour (plate), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Mezzoloth Chitin x1 (Blacksmith)

ability to speak Abyssal and Infernal if you did not know

damage.
```
##### Mimic Gel

```
Oil, uncommon
Crafted by: Mimic Gel x1 vial (Alchemist)
This vial contains enough gel to cover an item no larger
than one square foot in surface area. Completely covering
an item in this gel and then leaving it for an hour causes it
to meld with the gel, giving it a permanent enchantment.
While a creature is holding an item melded with mimic gel,
they may spend an action to change its appearance to
anything else of the same approximate size and
configuration. This appearance change is an illusion only
and fails to hold up to physical inspection. Otherwise, a
creature can use its action to inspect the item and discern
its true nature by succeeding on a DC 13 Intelligence
(Investigation) check.
```

##### Mind Whip

_Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunment)
Crafted by: Mind Flayer Tentacle x4 (Leatherworker)_
When you make a grapple check, you may choose to do so

with this whip instead of using your free hand. If you do so
and if you succeed on the grapple check, you may force the
grappled creature to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence
saving throw or be stunned until the grapple ends. While
grappling a creature, this whip may not be used to attack

another target. Once this ability has been used 4 times in a
day, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

##### Minotaur Compass

_Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Minotaur Heart x1 (Artificer)_
When you hold this compass and focus on a location that
you have been to, this compass points you in the direction

you would need to take to retrace your steps back to that
location, so long as it is on the same plane of existence as
you. This may not necessarily be the fastest or the most
direct route, especially if you have taken many detours

since leaving that location last.

##### Monocle of Focus

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

_Crafted by: Cyclops Eye x1 (Artificer)_
While wearing this item, you may spend an action to focus
on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you and
designate them as your target. You never suffer from

disadvantage when you make weapon attacks against your
target, and any opportunity attacks you make against your
target is done at advantage.
If you lose sight of your target, or if you make an attack
against a creature that is not your target, this effect ends

immediately.

lycanthropy if taken before that creature experiences its
first full moon as a lycanthrope. If drunk after that, or if
drunk by a natural born lycanthrope, a lycanthrope is able

to ignore the usual transformative effects of the full moon
for the next 28 days.

##### Mummy Rot Juice

```
Potion, rare
Crafted by: Mummy Dust 1x small pouch (Alchemist)
A noxious potion brewed from the corpse dust of a mummy.
It carries much of the lethal mummy rot that the cursed
creatures are known for. This potion has a murky brown
colour and smells roughly like an opened tomb; however,
the smell can be covered easily enough with an
overpowering scent.
When you drink this potion, you must succeed on a DC
12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy
rot. While cursed, you cannot regain hit points, and your hit
point maximum decreases by 3d6 for every 24 hours that
elapse. If the curse reduces your hit point maximum to 0,
you die, and your body turns to dust. This curse lasts until
removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.
```
##### Negative Energy Crystal

```
Wondrous item, very rare
Crafted by: Death Tyrant Eye x1 (Artificer)
This roughly basket sized crystal generates a 150-foot
radius field of negative energy that disrupts the natural
flow of life in the area. While in this field, creatures cannot
regain hit points, and any humanoid that dies inside it rises
one round later as a zombie. This field passes through all
solid objects except a layer of silver that is at least 1/2 inch
thick. This crystal cannot be deactivated and only stops
functioning if it is destroyed.
The crystal has 30 hit points, 15 AC and is immune to
poison and psychic damage.
```
##### Night Hag Dreamcatcher

```
Wondrous item, uncommon

A creature that sleeps with their head under this item only
has good dreams and are immune to any magical effect

chance that they will enter a shared dream in which they
may interact with each other freely.
```
##### Nightmare Skull

```
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Night Hag Skull x1 (Thaumaturge)
A creature that sleeps within 30 feet of this item is racked
with bad dreams and receives no benefit from that sleep. In
addition, while holding this item, you may cast the sleep
spell at 2nd level. Once this ability has been used once, it
cannot be used again until the next dawn.
```

##### Obfuscation Pigments

_Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Displacer Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)_
This pot contains enough paint to cover up to 10 square

feet of surface area. Any object completely covered by this
paint becomes covered in a unique enchantment that
makes it elusive and difficult to recognise for the next hour.
Although the object remains the same visually, it
becomes psychologically blocked out by any creature that is

not already aware of its presence. For example, even if this
dagger was seen by random strangers on the street, they
would not cognitively recognise it and would most likely
ignore it unless forced to interact with it.

Any attempt to find an item covered in this paint by
someone actively searching for it is rolled at disadvantage.
However, a creature that touches an item covered in this
paint, or who is verbally informed of its presence, ceases to

be influenced by this paint’s ability.

##### Ocean Master Paint

_Wondrous item, rare_

_Crafted by: Dragon Turtle Blood x1 gallon (Alchemist)_
This bucket contains 1 gallon of paint which is capable of
coating 10 square feet of material. Coating 100 square feet
of material takes 10 minutes. Anytime a creature with

either the amphibious or water breathing trait, and an
Intelligence score of less than 10 attempts to move within
20 feet of a coated object, they must roll a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw. On a failure, that creature must instead use

all of its available speed to move away from the coated
object or creature by the safest route possible. If there is no
safe route to use, it instead stays where it is and loses the
rest of its speed for that turn.
A coated object stays coated for 24 hours. Applying a

new coat refreshes the 24-hour duration.

##### Oni Amulet

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

_Crafted by: Oni Heart x1 (Artificer)_
The heart of an oni, transfigured into a dark crystal. It
seems to pulse with the corrupted radiance of the night,
and those that gaze at it long enough swear they can see

two pinpricks of white gazing back at them. While attuned
to this amulet, you become more oni-like as your eyes
become black with large white pupils, and two small, white,
ivory nubs grow out of your forehead. If you are both

wearing and attuned to this amulet, you gain the following
benefits:

```
You may spend a bonus action to summon a magical
glaive into your empty hand. You are proficient in
wielding this glaive if you weren’t already before. In
addition, if for whatever reason you grow in size, this
glaive grows in proportion with you and deals an
additional 1d10 damage if you become larger than
Medium sized. This glaive disappears if it is out of your
hand for more than 1 minute.
You gain darkvision out to 60 ft.
You gain proficiency in the Deception skill if you did not
have it already.
You can speak and understand Giant if you could not
already.
You may cast the charm person spell once per day. Your
spell DC for the casting of this spell is 8 + your
Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.

weapon. When you hit a Medium or smaller sized creature
with this weapon, you may make a grapple check against
them as a free action, using the whip to grapple instead of
your free hand. This ability can only be used once per turn.
While you have a creature grappled in this way, you may
not attack with this whip.
```
##### Paralyzing Dust

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Ghoul Claw x1, or Ghast Claw x1 (Alchemist)
You may spend an action to blow this pouch of grey dust
into the face of a non-undead creature within 5 feet of you.
That creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution
saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. That creature
may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn,
ending the effect on a success.
If this dust is dissolved into a liquid first and then drunk
by a non-undead creature, they automatically fail the save
and all subsequent saves for the next minute.
```
##### Petrifying Dagger

```
Weapon (dagger), uncommon (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Cockatrice Beak x1 (Blacksmith)
If this dagger strikes any non-living organic matter that is
smaller than half a cubic foot in volume, it is instantly
turned to stone for 24 hours.
If a tiny creature is hit by this dagger, they must succeed
on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw against being
magically petrified. On a failed save, the creature begins to
turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving
throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect
ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 24 hours.
```
##### Pillow of Perfect Rest

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Couatl Feather x1 large pouch (Artificer)
This pillow is stuffed with couatl feathers and is
extraordinarily soft and comfortable. A creature sleeping
on this pillow only has good dreams and only requires half
their usual sleeping time in order to feel properly rested
(the length of a long rest is unaffected though).
In addition, a creature sleeping on this pillow is immune
to scrying attempts and to any effect that would sense its
emotions, read its thoughts, or detect its location. It is also
immune to any magical effect that would affect its sleep,
such as the spell dream. Only one creature may benefit
from this pillow’s effect at a time.
```
##### Poison Lung

```
Wondrous item, very rare
Crafted by: Poison Canister x1 (Tinker)
This item resembles an iron cylinder attached to a leathery
sack capable of being filled with air. While holding this
item, you may spend an action to squeeze the sack to
release a 15-foot cone of poisonous gas in front of you.
Each creature in that area must make a DC 19
Constitution saving throw, taking 10d8 poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Once used,
this item may not be used again for another 1d8 hours.
```

cursed in this way, you gain darkvision out to 120 ft. if you

did not have it already, and whenever you receive necrotic
damage, you instead heal the amount of damage you would
have taken. In addition, whenever an undead creature with
less than 10 Intelligence targets you with a harmful attack

or spell, it must first make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or
lose the attack or spell.
Every night at midnight while cursed, you must succeed

on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become dominated by
the death knight from whose blood this potion was crafted,
as if under the effect of the _dominate person_ spell, but with
an indefinite duration, no concentration required, and
unlimited range. The death knight is aware of this taking

place unless it is on a different plane of existence.
This curse can only be removed if the death knight from
whom the blood was taken is permanently destroyed, after
which point the curse immediately ends.

##### Potion of Detect Thoughts

_Potion, uncommon
Crafted by: Flumph Brain x1 (Alchemist)_

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the _detect
thoughts_ spell. This potion is completely clear except for a
small pink blog floating in the centre of it.

that is invisible or on the Ethereal Plane. You can pinpoint
such a creature that is moving.
If you are a spellcaster, you also gain the ability to cast
any spell on the cleric spell list (excluding cantrips) for
which you would have spell slots available. Any time you
cast a spell known in this way, you suffer psychic damage
equal to the spell level of that spell multiplied by 3. This
damage is unmitigable in any way. Any attempt to record
the knowledge of these spells fails as they inevitably
become incomprehensible ramblings to you once the
madness fades.

disease for 1d12 hours. While sick in this way, your nose

When you drink this potion, your physiology changes
entirely and your blood becomes icy cold for 1d4 hours.
During this time, you are immune to cold damage, and any
time a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack

that deals piercing or slashing damage, they suffer 2d6 cold
damage. This potion is bright blue with frost constantly
encasing the glass.

##### Potion of Winter’s Rest

_Potion, rare
Crafted by: Yeti Eye x1 (Alchemist)_
This potion is constantly cool to the touch and appears to
have snowflakes floating in the middle of it. If you willingly

drink this potion, you enter a comatose state and fall
unconscious and then immediately become encased in a
block of ice that extends half a foot away from your body in
either direction. While inside this ice block, you are

considered behind total cover in all directions. You also do
not age, require food, drink, or sleep, and any physical
ailments including diseases and poisons halt their effect. If
you were on 0 hit points you are also instantly stabilised.

You instantly wake up if the ice block is destroyed, and all of
these effects end. The ice block has AC 12, 30 hit points, is
immune to psychic and poison damage and is vulnerable to
fire damage. The ice block does not melt under non-

magical sources of heat.
If you unwillingly drink this potion, you may make a DC
13 Constitution saving throw to avoid being encased in the
ice block, taking only 3d6 cold damage instead.

##### Purple Piercer

_Weapon, (spear, lance, or pike), very rare (requires
attunement)_

_Crafted by: Purple Worm Stinger x1 (Blacksmith)_
This weapon possesses a wickedly curved head, taken from
the stinger of a purple worm. You gain +3 to attack and
damage rolls made with this weapon. Once per day, you

may use a bonus action to cause the spearhead to secrete
purple worm venom. The next time you successfully hit a
creature with this weapon, the target must succeed on a
DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 12d6 poison
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

successful one.

##### Remorhaz Plate

```
Armour (plate), very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Young Remorhaz Carapace x1 or Adult
Remorhaz Carapace x1 (Blacksmith)
This full set of plate armour was crafted from the insectoid
carapace of a remorhaz. While wearing this armour, you
have resistance to both fire and cold damage.
If this was crafted from an Adult Remorhaz Carapace,
you also gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armour.
```
##### Repelling Candle

```
Wondrous item, common
Crafted by: Ogre Fat x1 vial (Alchemist)
This pale-yellow candle is made from ogre tallow and emits
a powerful odour when burned. Any beast that possesses
the keen smell trait or similar that starts their turn within
100 feet of this lit candle, must succeed on a DC 12
Constitution saving throw or be forced to spend their turn
moving as far away from this candle as safely possible. A
creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to
this effect for 24 hours. This item otherwise acts as a
normal candle and will last for a total of 1 hour while lit.
```
##### Ring of Storm Giant Growth

```
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Roc Heart Piece x1 (Artificer)
While wearing this ring, you may speak the command word
to grow to the size of a storm giant for 10 minutes. If there
isn’t enough space, this ability fails. Your weapons and
carried equipment grow with you while you are under this
effect. While under this effect, you are considered a Huge
creature and gain the following benefits:
```
```
Your Strength score is considered 29
You gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution
modifier multiplied by your character level
You gain immunity to lightning damage.
As an action, you may hurl a lightning bolt at a point you
can see within 500 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of
that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 12d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. Once this ability is
used, it may not be used again until the next time the
ring is used.
```
```
Once used, this ring cannot be used again for the next 7
days.
```
##### Salamander Fire

```
Oil, uncommon
Crafted by: Salamander Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)
This vial contains 3 doses. Salamander fire is a highly
viscous oil that is incredibly flammable and yet strangely
easy to control. You may spend an action to cover a melee
weapon in a dose of this oil and set it alight. While on fire
in this way, a weapon deals an extra 1d6 fire damage on a
successful hit and also sheds bright light out to a distance
of 10 feet and dim light for a further 10 feet. The weapon
will continue to burn for 1 minute before extinguishing
itself. Traditional methods of extinguishing the flame do not
work unless they manage to take the oil itself off the melee
weapon.
```

##### Security Antennae

_Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Remorhaz Antenna x2 (Tinker)_
These long blue rods are the result of applying additional

enchantments to the severed antennae of a remorhaz. As
an action, you may speak a command word while holding
the antennae and then plant them into soft ground. For the
next 8 hours, or until the antennae are removed from the
ground, the antennae will mentally alert you if it detects a

creature moving on or in the ground within 90 feet. When
alerted in this way, you become aware of the distance and
direction of the creature, its approximate size, and the
speed it is moving.

When you plant the antennae in the ground, you may
choose for the antennae to not alert you to creatures above
or below a certain size of your choosing or creatures
moving above or below a certain speed threshold. Once

planted, the security antennae cannot be used again for
another 16 hours.

##### Sensory Collar

_Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Otyugh Telepathy Ganglia x1 (Tinker)_
This collar, made from the same bundle of nerves that
grant the brutish otyugh limited telepathy, grants beasts a

similar ability. When worn by a beast with an Intelligence
score of 6 or less, that beast may transmit simple messages
and images to any creature within 120 feet of it. This form
of telepathy doesn’t allow the receiving creature to

telepathically respond, nor does it necessarily allow the
receiving creature to understand a message that has been
sent if it does not understand the language used by the
beast (if any). As a whole, a beast will tend to send
messages of emotions and non-verbal feelings rather than

actual worded messages.

##### Serpent Shield

_Armour (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

_Crafted by: Yuan-Ti Abomination Scales x1 large pouch
(Blacksmith)_
This shield is plated with scales taken from a yuan-ti
abomination and pulses with the residual divine magic of

the serpent gods. While wearing this shield, you may spend
a bonus action to transform the shield and the arm holding
it into a single serpent attached to your shoulder for the
next 10 minutes.

This shield does not provide any bonus to AC while it is
in serpent form. You may make melee weapon attacks with
your serpent appendage by having it bite your targets.
When used for melee weapon attacks, your serpent

appendage is considered to have the finesse, reach, and
light properties and deals 1d4 piercing damage plus 1d6
poison damage on a successful hit. You may at any point,
spend a bonus action to transform your serpent appendage

back into your arm and shield.
Once this ability has been used, you may not use it again
until the end of your next long rest.

##### Shadow Amulet

```
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Demonic Imprint x1 (Thaumaturge)
When you are holding this item, you may spend an action
to summon a shadow demon in an unoccupied space
within 5 feet of you (refer to the Monster Manual for the
relevant statblock). This shadow demon is friendly towards
you and allies that you designate and obeys your
commands. The shadow demon has access to all of its
normal abilities and features and acts directly after your
turn. The shadow demon disappears after 1 minute, if it
drops to 0 hit points, you become unconscious, or if it ends
its turn more than 30 feet away from the amulet.
Whenever the shadow demon is summoned, there is a 10
per cent chance that this item will instead shatter, releasing
the shadow demon from the amulet and freeing it from
your control. In this case, it rolls for initiative and acts on its
own turn, and is unfriendly to any creature around it. It
does not disappear unless it is reduced to 0 hit points.
```
##### Shadow Wing Cape

```
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Shadowdragon Wing x2 (Leatherworker)
While wearing this cape in dim light, you have a flying
speed of 20 feet. This flying speed is increased to 40 feet in

```
Oil, rare
Crafted by: Shadowflame Ember x1 vial (Alchemist)
The oil in this vial can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of
slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or
piercing weapon. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For the
next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit by this
weapon or ammunition takes an extra 2d6 necrotic
damage. If this weapon or ammunition kills a creature, a
shadow under your control rises from that corpse (refer to
the Monster Manual for the relevant statblock). This
shadow acts directly after you in the initiative count and
disappears after 1 hour or if it or you fall unconscious.
```
##### Shell of Hearing

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Hooked Horror Cochlea x1 (Tinker)
While you have this shell next to your ear, you gain
advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
hearing.
```
##### Shield of Reflection

```
Armour (shield), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Spectator Main Eye x1 (Blacksmith)
This shield has what appears to be a spectator’s eye
engraved in the middle of it. While wearing this shield, if
you make a successful saving throw against a spell, or a
spell attack misses you, you may spend your reaction to
choose another creature (including the spellcaster) that you
can see within 30 feet of you. The spell targets the chosen
creature instead of you. If the spell forced a saving throw,
the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an
attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen
creature.
```

##### Sickle of Chaos

_Weapon (sickle), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Blue Slaad Claw x1 (Blacksmith)_
This wicked scythe continues to carry the chaotic, but fair,

energies of Limbo inherit in all slaadi. You gain +1 to attack
and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you make
an attack against a creature with this weapon, you may
choose to do so at disadvantage. If your attack is successful,
the creature you attacked also has disadvantage on the next

attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. This
ability cannot be used if you were to already attack at
disadvantage.

##### Siege Dust

_Wondrous item, very rare
Crafted by: Goristro Horn x2 (Blacksmith)_
This bag of fine brown dust contains great magical energy

that can be imparted on weapons that are left to soak in its
power. If a melee weapon that deals bludgeoning damage is
left in a bath of this dust for 24 hours, it gains the following
properties permanently:

```
Any attack and damage roll made with this weapon is
made with a +3 bonus.
Any attack made with this weapon to an object or
structure deals double damage.
Any attack made with this weapon ignores an object’s
damage threshold if it has one.
If the wielder of this weapon moves at least 15 feet
straight towards a target and then hits them with a
melee weapon attack with this weapon, that target
suffers an extra 4d8 bludgeoning damage and must
succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be
pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone.
```
##### Skull of Revelation

```
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Flameskull x1 (Artificer)
This skull has a small black candle embedded in its crown.
While this candle is lit, the skull activates and sheds a
bright light in a 15-foot radius, and dim light for an
additional 15 feet. If you make an Intelligence based check
to evaluate anything contained within the bright light, you
make that check with advantage.
The candle has a duration of 1 hour. Once this duration
has expired, the candle must be replaced with another
candle that costs 50 gp.
```

```
##### Spectral Gauntlets

```
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Spirit Echo x1 (Thaumaturge)
While wearing these gloves, you are able to see into the
Ethereal Plane up to a range of 30 feet. In addition, these
gloves are capable of touching objects and creatures in the
Border Ethereal as if they were on the same plane of
existence as you.
If you use these gloves while grappling a creature in the
Ethereal Plane, you may spend your action to make a
contested Strength (Athletics) check against them. If you
succeed, you may pull that creature into your plane of
existence and into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of
you. A creature that is forced out of the Ethereal Plane in
this way may not return there for 1 minute.
```
##### Staff of Multiplied Recovery

```
Staff, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Hydra Spinal Cord x1 (Artificer)
If you hold this staff while casting a spell that would allow a
creature to roll dice to recover hit points, any time that
creature rolls the maximum value on one of those die rolls,
they may roll an additional dice and add that to the amount
of healing received. The amount of final dice rolled while
under this effect may not exceed double the initial amount.
```

##### Stinger Whip

_Weapon (whip), rare
Crafted by: Bone Devil Tail x1 (Tinker)_
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with

this weapon. This retrofitted tail has a compartment fitted
into where the bone devil’s poisonous gland would have
been, that allows for easier and more efficient uses of
poisons. Any poison applied to this weapon lasts twice as
long as it normally does and takes half as long to apply.

Furthermore, if a creature must roll a Constitution saving
throw due to a poison applied to this weapon, that saving
throw is made at disadvantage.

##### Stone Anvil

_Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Stone Giant Molar x1 (Artificer)_
This large anvil has been crafted partly out of the molar of a

stone giant. This anvil is magically enchanted so that
sufficiently heated stones that have been placed on it act

original stone properties once removed from the anvil.

damage, or half that on a success. Once this ability has
been used once, it cannot be used again until the next

This 10-foot-long, 40-pound pole constantly crackles with
energy and has an innate connection to the storms and

under an open sky, a lightning bolt will strike it from the
skies every 1d4 hours. Any creature within 5 feet of the
pole when this happens suffers 12d8 lightning damage, or
half that on a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.
A switch on the base of the pole may also be flipped,
which causes lightning to strike this pole once every 6
seconds (on initiative count 20 if done during combat) for
the next minute, after which the switch flips to the off
position. A creature may also spend their action to flip the
switch back prematurely. Once the switch has been flipped
off, it cannot be flipped back on for another 24 hours.
```
##### Titan Ship

Wondrous item, artifact

In addition, this ship is immune to fire damage as well as

magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a
ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the ship is
unaffected. On a 6, the ship is unaffected, and the effect is
reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the
ship, turning the caster into the target.
```
##### Traveller’s Clogs

```
Wondrous item, common

hours.
```

##### Troll Amulet

This amulet contains the crystallised form of a troll heart

preserved in tar. While wearing and attuned to this amulet,
you may spend an action to activate it. For the next minute,
you regain 10 hit points at the start of your turn so long as
you haven’t taken acid or fire damage since the end of your
last turn and so long as you start your turn with at least 1

hit point.
Once you have used this ability once, you cannot use it
again until the next dawn.

##### Turned Soul Gem

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Soul Gem x1 (Thaumaturge)_
While you are holding this item, you may target one

creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That target must
make a Charisma saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your
Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed
save, the target's soul is magically trapped inside this gem.

While the soul is trapped, the target's body and all the
equipment it is carrying cease to exist. On a successful
save, the target takes 7d6 necrotic damage, and if this
damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, its soul is

trapped as if it failed the saving throw. A soul trapped in a
gem for 24 hours is devoured and ceases to exist, and this
gem gains 1 charge.
If you die while holding this gem, and if this gem has at

least 1 charge, you return to life within 1d10 days so long
as the gem is in contact with you for the entire duration. If
it ever leaves contact with you, the magic of the gem fades
and becomes a mundane object. At the end of the 1d10
days, the gem loses 1 charge and you return to life as if the

_reincarnate_ spell had been cast on you, with your new body
identical to one of the creatures whose soul had been
devoured by this item (chosen randomly). Once a body has
been chosen, it cannot be chosen again.

Crushing this gem releases any soul trapped within, at
which point the target's body re-forms in an unoccupied
space nearest to the gem and in the same state as when it
was trapped.

##### Unicorn Glue

_Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Unicorn Hoof x1 (Alchemist)_.

This slightly translucent pot of glue is the colour of a full
moon on a clear day. When a creature attempts to roll hit
die during a short rest to recover hit points, 1 dose of this
glue may be applied to that creature to allow them to skip

the dice roll and instead regain the maximum number of
hit points possible.
Alternatively, you may reattach a severed appendage by
applying 1 dose of this glue to the respective wound and

holding the severed appendage to it for 10 minutes. After
this time, the limb completely reattaches itself leaving no
mark except a faint scar. One pot of unicorn glue contains
enough glue for 5 doses.

##### Unicorn’s Charge

_Weapon (any melee weapon that deals piercing damage),
rare
Crafted by: Unicorn Horn x1 (Blacksmith)_

You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this
weapon. If you are a good-aligned character, when you hit a
creature with this weapon, you may deal an additional 2d6
radiant damage in addition to the weapon’s damage.

```
Once you use this ability you may not use it again for one
hour, or until you have landed the killing blow on an evil-
aligned creature, whichever comes first.
```
##### Wand of Confusion

```
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Umber Hulk Eye x2 (Artificer)
This wand has 4 charges. While holding it, you can use an
action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the
confusion spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast
the 4th-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell
slot level by one for each additional charge you spend.
The wand regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn. If you
expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand
crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
```
##### Wand of the Undergrowth

```
Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a spellacaster)
Crafted by: Root-stem x1 (Artificer)
This wand has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an
action to expend 1 or more charges to cast the blight spell
(save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 4th-level
version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by
one for each additional charge you expend.
The wand regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.
If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the
wand crumbles into compost and is destroyed.
```
```
Additionally, you may use an action to plant the wand into
soft soil. If you do so, the wand drains the energy of all
living beings around it. All creatures and plants within a 30-
foot radius of the wand are subjected to a DC 15 blight
spell (cast at 4th-level). If the total damage dealt to all
targets exceeds 65, the wand transforms into a shambling
mound with the same amount of HP that was just dealt, up
to a maximum of 136. This shambling mound has no
allegiance to any creature around it and will act in its own
interest. If the wand did not deal more than 65 damage, the
wand simply crumbles into compost and is destroyed.
```
##### Warming Waterskin

```
Wondrous item, common
Crafted by: Salamander Scales x1 small pouch

Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Owlbear Neck x1 (Leatherworker)
While you wear this feather covered scarf, you receive a
slight tingling sensation in your neck whenever a hostile
creature within 30 feet is looking directly at you. A creature
that is aware of this scarf’s property may make a DC 10
Wisdom saving throw to not trigger this scarf’s ability when
they look at you. If they succeed, they do not trigger the
scarf’s ability, and they are immune to this scarf’s effect for
the next 24 hours.
While wearing this scarf, you also gain the ability to twist
your head around 180 degrees around without injuring
yourself.
```

##### Wings of the Guardian

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Sphinx Wing x2 (Leatherworker)_
These wings are joined to a leather harness that allows a

humanoid to comfortably wear them on their back. While
wearing these wings, you have a flight speed equal to your
movement speed.
In addition, you may spend your action to teleport
yourself and any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up

to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you
have used this ability once, you may not use it again until
you finish your next short rest.

##### Wound Biter Weapon

_Weapon (pike, spear, or whip), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Horned Devil Tail x1 (Blacksmith)_
When you make a successful hit with this weapon on a

creature that is not either an undead or a construct, that
creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or lose 2d6 hit points at the start of each of its turns
due to an infernal wound. Each time this weapon hits the

wounded target, the damage dealt by the wound increases
by 2d6.
Any creature adjacent to the wounded target can take an
action to staunch the wound with a successful DC 12

Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the
target receives magical healing.

##### Vine Tunic

```
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Shambling Mound Vines x4 (Artificer)

damage. Furthermore, if you are subjected to lightning
damage, you take no damage and regain a number of hit
points equal to the lightning damage dealt instead.

```
Weapon (pike, spear, lance, or javelin), rarity varies (+1)
Crafted by: Skeletal Naga Fang x2 (rare), Spirit Naga Fang
x2 (very rare), Guardian Naga Fang x2 (very rare)
(Blacksmith)
When you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon,
you deal an additional 10 poison damage, or 14 poison
damage if you are using the ‘very rare’ version of this
weapon. If you are using the ‘very rare’ version of this
weapon, you also gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls
made with this weapon.
```
##### Yeenoghu’s Boon

```
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Demon Gnoll Heart x1 (Thaumaturge)
If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack
on your turn while wearing this charm, you may take a
bonus action to move up to half your speed and then make
another basic melee weapon attack. Once this ability has
been used once, it cannot be used again until you have
taken a short rest.
```

## Chapter 5: Tools & Other Additions

# H

_arvesting is a holistic art. It is not simply
the physical act of cutting and slicing
through a carcass, it is the tools you use,
the rules you live by and the skills you have;
in short it is an entire lifestyle! Once you
have assumed the life of a harvester, you
will see the world in a different way, and
find the new possibilities and options open to you._

_However, in the case that you haven’t, I’ve listed them down
here for you anyway.”_ - Hamund

This guide introduces a few new concepts into the base

game of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, and as part of
that, a few slight alterations and/or additions need to be
made to existing concepts and features in the game to
accommodate them. While some of these changes are not

strictly necessary for this guide to be used, they are advised
in order to get the maximum value out of this book.

### Special Tools

A few new pieces of adventuring gear have been added in
this book to accommodate the act of harvesting. Their
functions are described below:

###### Enchanted Vial

Some creature parts have powerful, yet fleeting, magical

energies within them. The motes from elementals for
example hold traces of their former essences in them but
disperse rapidly upon the destruction of their original form.
An enchanted vial is inlaid with several runes designed
to keep any magical resource within from dissipating while

the lid is closed and is often the only way of transporting
certain parts back to a workshop for crafting.
Items that require an enchanted vial to be harvested are
fragile by nature and must be stored inside an enchanted

vial quickly to prevent degradation. **Any attempt to
harvest a material that has an enchanted vial as a
requirement must be initiated within 1 minute of the
death of its creature.**

###### Hamund’s Harvesting Handbook

_“Yes, you can own a copy of this very book in any plane you
visit! Due to my travels, I have visited almost every world in
the multiverse, dropping manuscripts in publishers’ hands_

_as I go. No matter where you are, or where you come from,
this handy book is sure to help you get the most out of
whatever your local fauna has to offer.”_ - Hamund

This book is filled with all sorts of useful information on
the creatures that inhabit the multiverse, specifically, which
parts of them are useful for harvesting. Using this book
grants you advantage on any Appraise ability check.

###### Harvesting Kit

This kit contains everything the average harvester needs to
prepare and harvest a carcass for usable parts including a
skinning knife, a bonesaw, 2 glass vials, pouches of salt,
and tweezers. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your
proficiency to any check made to harvest a creature.

###### Spirit Paper

```
Spirit paper is a versatile tool that resembles a square of
bleached papyrus. The secrets of its production were only
recently discovered, and reverse engineered from secrets
brought back from distant necromantic cults. By
performing a small ritual with the spirit paper shortly after
slaying certain creatures, a copy of that creature’s soul is
bound to the spirit paper for later use. These copies are not
a true soul and are more akin to an echo. These echoes do
retain all of the memories from its original body, and a few
crafting techniques utilise these echoes to grant an item a
low level of sentience or to mimic the abilities of their
incorporeal reflections.
Using spirit paper is often the only way to harvest
anything useful from creatures with incorporeal forms. Any
harvesting attempt made for a creature part that has spirit
paper as a requirement is done using a Wisdom (Religion)
check rather than the usual check and is rolled separately
for each item. Once a sheet of spirit paper has been used
successfully to harvest an item, it cannot be reused, even if
the item it contained is released.
Unlike most harvestable materials, materials that require
spirit paper to be harvested dissipate very quickly after the
death of its creature. Any attempt to harvest a material that
has spirit paper as a requirement must be initiated within 1
minute of the death of the creature and takes 10
minutes to successfully complete.

### Additions and Changes

```
The following are a few balance changes to accomodate the
harvesting and crafting rules in this guide, as well as a
background and feat to incorporate harvesting into your
game.
```
#### New Proficiency: Harvesting Kit

```
This guide adds in the new tool: the harvesting kit. Players
may have proficiency in this like any other tool, and it is
highly advised for them to have it as it provides a valuable
bonus when making the checks outlined in this book. In
order to accommodate this additional tool, the following
classes and backgrounds have been slightly altered to give
them the option to gain proficiency in the Harvesting Kit.
```
```
Rangers may have proficiency with the harvesting kit
upon character creation (this skill is not gained in
multiclassing)
Druids may have the option to choose between
proficiency in the herbalism kit or the harvesting kit
upon character creation (this skill is not gained in
multiclassing)
```

```
The Hermit background may choose between the
herbalism kit and the harvesting kit as its starting tool
proficiency and gains the appropriate kit as part of its
starting equipment.
The Outlander background may choose between a
musical instrument or the harvesting kit as its initial
tool proficiency. They may also choose between a
hunting trap, and the harvesting kit in its initial starting
equipment.
```
#### New Background: Harvester

Like a miner in their cave or a farmer in their field, you too

make your living through reaping the riches of the natural
world. Your resources, however, are the monsters and
creatures that populate the multiverse. Although there are
some who would scoff and call you a mere butcher, you

understand the subtle complexities in the fantastical
anatomies you find in your adventures, and only you are
qualified enough to harvest them.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Nature, Survival
**Tool Proficiencies:** Harvesting Kit
**Languages:** One of your choice
**Equipment:** A set of traveller’s clothes, a hunting trap,

harvesting kit, a cloak made from a creature you
harvested,
and a belt pouch containing 5 gp.

##### Feature: Connected

You have been harvesting creatures for a long time and as
part of that, you have become deeply acquainted with the
large industry of crafters and merchants that rely on the
wares you bring. Whenever you enter a place of civilisation,

you have no trouble finding merchants willing to buy your
materials or crafters that can work with your wares. You
are also savvy in the bargaining techniques used when
haggling over prices and are not easily tricked during

negotiations. You often find yourself able to secure a good
price, or even a discount on services relating to harvested
materials.

##### Suggested Characteristics

Harvesters are an odd bunch; half outdoorsman, half
entrepreneur. As someone who spends most of their time
in the hunting and being elbow deep in dead bodies, you

probably have a different worldview compared to most.

```
d8Personality Trait
1 I am often covered in blood and viscera, which other
people find off-putting.
```
```
2 I see no moral issue about harvesting any once-living
creature, even if they were clearly sentient. "Waste
not, want not", after all.
```
```
3 I often unnerve people with my discussions of the
more disgusting aspects of creature anatomy.
```
```
4 I am obsessed with self-sufficiency; anything I wear
must have come from something I harvested.
```
```
5 I say a small prayer before harvesting a fresh kill,
thanking it for its sacrifice.
6 The hunt is what excites me more than anything.
Harvesting is just how I keep mementos of my prey.
```
```
7 I insist on using every little bit of what I kill, it would
be an insult to that creature's life otherwise.
8 I have a myriad of harvested trophies from rare game
which I show off whenever possible.
```
```
d6Ideal
```
```
1 Life. Harvested meat will feed the hungry, harvested
furs will warm the cold. Through death, comes life.
(Good)
```
```
2 Honor. I refuse to use something harvested from a
creature that I did not kill with my own hands.
(Lawful)
```
```
3 Necessity. Creatures kill and harvest other creatures
to survive. You may not like it, but it's just the way
things are. (Neutral)
4 Opportunity. If something is already dead, what's the
point of letting its corpse go to waste? (Chaotic)
```
```
5 Dominance. Nothing shows off your strength like
having your own Owlbear-head trophy. (Evil)
6 Money. People always want hides, pelts, and skins; I
may as well be the one to profit off it. (Any)
```
```
d6Bond
1 My clan won't respect me unless I bring back the
head of a rare and dangerous creature.
```
```
2 Ever since I was a child, I dreamed of wearing a
unicorn fur cloak. If you have a better way of getting
one, I'd like to hear it.
```
```
3 Hunting and harvesting creatures is the only way I
know how to make money and feed my family.
```
```
4 Visions of a monstrously large creature haunt my
dreams. They won’t stop until I find it and claim its
pelt for my cloak.
```
```
5 I am interested in studying the anatomy of rare and
magical creatures and I need samples to continue my
research.
```
```
6 Harvesting creatures has been my family's
profession for generations; I'm just continuing this
long line of tradition.
```
```
d6Flaw
```
```
1 Once I decide that a creature will become my next
trophy, nothing will stop me from getting it.
```
```
2 Some would say I get a little too much pleasure in
slicing corpses open and tearing out their fresh
organs.
3 I'm always looking for the next big hunt, something
that will probably get me killed.
```
```
4 I tend to exaggerate the quality of my harvested
wares to inflate their price.
5 Once I kill something, I will drop everything to take a
trophy from it before moving on.
```
```
6 I see other living creatures as just organs in a skin
bag, waiting to be sold.
```
#### New Feat: Resourceful

```
You’ve always hated leaving anything to waste and have
always made sure you get the most out of any situation.
```
```
You gain proficiency in the harvesting kit and the
herbalism kit.
You ignore any penalties for harvesting a creature that
died a particularly violent death.
Both appraising and harvesting a creature take half the
time than it normally would.
```

### Hamund's Helpers

_“Throughout my travels I have met many spectacular
individuals. Among them are master crafters, each peculiar
in their own ways, but all of them capable of weaving
miracles from materials. I know not where these_

_remarkable people are today, perhaps they have finally
settled down somewhere and opened a steady shop. Or
they are like me and continue to indulge their wanderlust;
roaming freely in this great world of ours while offering_

_their skills to anyone who has the coin and materials. I list
their names here in my book, to recommend their services
to any of my dear readers. And if you are lucky enough to
meet them, simply mention my name and I am sure you_

_will receive first-rate service.”_ -Hamund

The following are a list of NPC crafters that a DM can
easily slot into any campaign or setting. Feel free to use

these NPC’s as convenient ways for the party to craft their
harvested materials into useful items, vendors to buy spare
materials, or even quest givers for certain monster parts.

##### Alchemist

**Name:** Lidda Littlelid
**Race:** Halfling
**Hamund’s Notes:** I’ve known Lidda since she was born, in

fact I was even the one who named her (a fact for which
she has never forgiven me). Rambunctious as a youth,
Lidda regularly came home with frogspawn, gristleweed,
milkgrass, and all matters of ingredients to perform her

little experiments. Since then, Lidda has grown into a
prestigious alchemist, able to mix even the most esoteric
ingredients into some sort of useful brew.
Despite being incredibly intelligent, Lidda does have a
tendency towards air-headedness. Thus, although she

tends to stay in her family home (as most halflings are
content to do), Lidda has a tendency to go on walks,
become incredibly enthralled by her thoughts and musings,
and then find herself hopelessly lost. On these occasions,

she can sometimes take upwards of several years before
she manages to stumble upon her home again, laden down
with new materials to experiment with from her travels.

##### Artificer

```
Name: Shareefah Khalid
Race: Human
Hamund’s Notes: If you look up the word “prodigy,” you
will find a picture of Shareefah (either that or a young
picture of me). Born to a wealthy family of artificers, the
young Shareefah received an education from the finest
tutors in the land, and routinely dismissed each one when
she promptly accelerated beyond what they could teach.
Discontent with simply learning the same tired old
lessons, Shareefah left her family and her inheritance
behind in order to learn everything that the wide multiverse
could offer her. She makes her living offering her services
to anyone who has an interesting material for her to work
with. Those that have met her can attest to her immense
prowess in the artificing craft, exemplified perfectly in the
portable workshop she designed: an entire hut she can
store inside a large ring on her finger.
```
##### Blacksmith

```
Name: Orsik Holderhek
Race: Dwarf
Hamund’s Notes: I will admit that the inclusion of Orsik in
this book is the result of biases on my part; he is my cousin
after all. Despite that however, Orsik has proven himself to
be one of our clan’s foremost blacksmiths (partly due to the
steady stream of exotic materials I provide him to
experiment with). He is equally as comfortable reforging a
broken farm scythe as he is at shaping demon scales into
an invincible suit of armour.
Holderheks are restless by nature, so it is common for
Orsik to leave his forge in search of interesting new locales,
stories, and materials. However, wherever he goes, he
always brings with him his favourite smithing hammer, a
good supply of high-intensity dragon coal, and his prized
shrinking anvil (something of his own creation). With these,
he is always ready to smith even the rarest of new
materials.
```

##### Leatherworker

**Name:** Malakar Uuthrakt
**Race:** Half-Elf

**Hamund’s Notes:** Malakar’s story is a familiar one to many
half-elves. The stigma of his mixed heritage caught him
between two worlds, unable to find a place in neither elvish
nor human societies. Crushed between two poor options,

Malakar picked a third: the wild.
Living as an outdoorsman, Malakar has proven himself
to be a hunter and harvester almost on par with myself.
One particular field in which he excels however is tanning

and leatherworking. Having killed and skinned almost
every creature imaginable, Malakar has taught himself how
to take the hides of fantastical beasts and mould them into
powerful pieces of armour and equipment.
His vagrant lifestyle naturally causes him to be found just

about anywhere, and it is not uncommon to find him having
set up a temporary storefront in a town while he considers
his next adventure.

##### Thaumaturge

```
Name: “Blind” Mardred
Race: Human (?)
Hamund’s Notes: I have known Mardred for a long time,
which is saying something considering the longevity of my
race, and the relative brevity of hers. Sometimes I do
question if she is actually human as she claims, or whether
I am simply the mark of a long-running private joke of hers.
Even more mysterious than her true age is which divine
patron she actually serves. Whenever I have asked her for
the identity of her god, she would simply smirk and say,
“the only one that matters.”
Despite everything, I still have found her to be a valuable
source of advice, leads, and information. This goes doubly
so for her skills as a thaumaturge, able to easily summon
forth divine blessings from reams of spirit paper, or able to
demand servitude from the harvested remains of demons.
Mardred tends to wander from town to town, offering her
services to any with the coin to pay, her arrival always
heralded by the rhythmic tapping of her walking stick.
```
##### Tinker

```
Name: Jarrod Gerkirk
Race: Gnome
Hamund’s Notes: If you are going to Jarrod for a spot of
conversation, you have gone to the wrong place. On the
other hand, if you are going to him for tinkering work, then
you could not be in better hands. A smarter gnome I have
never met, and his inventions are so fantastical that he
blurs the line between mechanical and magical.
Although Jarrod tends to keep to himself and wiles away
the years performing experiments in his laboratory, there
are times when he becomes overwhelmed by unexplainable
feelings of wanderlust. When these episodes arise, Jarrod
inevitably hits the open road on his customised
wagon/workshop, ready to make new inventions with
whatever fresh materials he finds.
```

## FAQ

_Q: Why didn't you include the meat you can harvest from creatures?_
A: I wanted to avoid relatively generic harvesting materials. Largely I assumed that DM's would be able to judge meat
harvesting by themselves without any need for a guide.

_Q: Can I give suggestions or feedback?_
A: Of course! This is a living document and I fully endorse anyone to send in item suggestions or balance feedback. See the
Contact Us section for contact details.

_Q: Can I change an item to suit my campaign?_
A: Feel free to do so. Items were designed to be setting agnostic and able to fit into anything, but edge cases could always
occur. I encourage DMs to use this guide as a launching point for their own ideas.

_Q: Will you be making a follow-up for Volo's Guide to Monsters and Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes?_
A: Yes I am. Volume 2 of Hamund's Harvesting Handbook is already available on the DM's Guild which covers Volo's Guide to
Monsters. Volume 3 is slated for release in late October.

_Q: How do your rules fit in with the newly released Artificer class on Unearthed Arcana?_
A: To be honest, they do not. The updated Artificer class was released very late into the development of this guide and as such,
this guide does not incoporate them at all. A future update may attempt to reconcile them.

_Q: Why don't you include the beast section?_
A: I felt that beasts were too mundane to include in the harvest table, and largely could be replaced by a DM googling an actual
butcher table.

_Q: How come you didn't include any loot like weapons and armour?_
A: Those items are largely context sensitive. After all, not every Hobgoblin walks around with a spear at all times, so I felt best
to leave those out and up to the DM to decide based on context.
