Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome back dear reader to another

installation of Hamund’s Harvesting
Handbook. By now I’m sure you’ve all cut
your teeth on the monsters and creatures
featured in Volume I of this series and have
come back hungry for more. Well you are in
luck, because I have spent the interim

hunting and harvesting all of the monsters featured in that
seminal work; Volo’s Guide to Monsters (written by another
man who appreciates the value of good branding) and have
prepared yet another catalogue of the natural riches to be
found in the creatures around us.

But wait, there’s more! I have brought back secret spells
from forgotten lands, filled a list of new items to craft, and
even compiled a compendium of the needy people I met on
my travels in the hopes that my readers may lend them a
helping hand. The book you hold is more than just an
instruction manual, it is a veritable travel guide to
adventure!

So, indulge yourselves dear readers in the knowledge that I
have gained and now pass onto you. Discover how to skin a
sea spawn, gut a grung, and debone a devourer (which is
quite a difficult feat considering they are almost nothing
but bones). Learn how to craft powerful weapons from the
spoils of your hunts, as well as wield new magic to aid you
in your work. The sky is the limit in our profession, and
even the old dogs among you could still stand to learn a few
new tricks.

Good luck and good harvesting,
-Sir Hamund Holderhek, O.B.H. (First Class), V.A., N.K.P.

Aim of this Guide

Thank you for purchasing the second instalment of the
“Hamund’s Harvesting Handbook” series. This volume
covers the monsters included in Volo’s Guide to Monsters,
and as before, features a complete harvesting list for each
monster, as well as over 80 new magical items to craft.

The rules for harvesting and crafting are unchanged, but
this book does add a few more interesting pieces to add to
your harvesting adventures. Premiering in this book are
new NPC merchants for you to pull out on the fly, 6 new
spells designed to help harvesters, as well as a job board
for every monster in the Monster Manual and Volo’s to help
DMs make harvesting-based quests on the fly.

Everything has been written with balance in mind, but you
are of course feel free to rebalance anything in this guide to
suit your own table, or feel free to message me at
driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com or hit me up on Twitter
@drifterworkshop to discuss anything in this guide.

Chapter 2: How to Harvest

The act of removing useful body parts from a

creature is referred to as harvesting.
Anything that can be harvested from a
creature is referred to as a harvesting
material or simply material. In general, only
creatures that have died may be harvested,
but there may be some exceptions based on

context.

This section details the steps associated with actually
performing a harvest, and any factors that may influence it.

Appraising

"Half of a harvester's job is mental, rather than physical. It
takes a keen eye, and an analytical mind to fully grasp the
nuance of slicing open a fresh kill and reaping the bounty
inside. Take your time to evaluate your prize before
chopping into it; your wallet will thank me later." - Hamund

Before a player begins hacking and butchering their hunt,
they may instead choose to take a moment first and
appraise the creature to be harvested. To do this, they must
spend 1 minute examining the creature to be harvested
and then roll an Intelligence check, adding their proficiency
bonus if they are proficient in the skill corresponding to
that creature (see table below). For example, when
appraising a banderhobb (which is a monstrosity), the
check would be an Intelligence (Nature) check, while
appraising a meenlock (which is a fey) would require an
Intelligence (Arcana) check.

The DC of the check is equal to 8 + the Harvested

Creature’s CR (treating any CR less than 1 as 0). Success
on this check grants the player full knowledge of any useful
harvesting materials on the creature, the DC requirement
to harvest those materials, any special requirements to
harvest them, and any potential risks in doing so. In
addition, any harvesting check made on that creature by
that player is rolled at advantage. A character may only
attempt one appraisal check per creature.

Splitting up the responsibilities
Some party members may prefer to let one character
handle the appraisal of materials, while another more
dextrous character handles the actual harvesting. In this
scenario, all benefits of appraising a creature are conferred
to the player doing the harvesting, so long as the player that
performed the appraising assists the harvesting player
through the whole duration of the harvest.

Harvesting

"The thing we've all bought this book to learn: harvesting!
Here you will learn the most noble of traditions, dating
back to our roots as hunter-gatherers. Read this section
well and commit it to memory, for harvesting is the true
meat of this book (pardon the pun)." - Hamund

In order to harvest a creature, a character must make a
Dexterity ability check using the same skill proficiency as
listed in the above appraising table. For example, a
character attempting a harvest check on an Aberrant would
receive a bonus equal to their Dexterity modifier and their
proficiency in Arcana (if they have any).

This check reflects a character’s ability to not only

properly remove the intended item without damaging it, it
also involves any ancillary requirements of the harvest such
as proper preservation and storage techniques.

Using other proficiencies
If a player is harvesting a certain creature, or harvesting a
creature of a certain type of material, the DM may allow
them to use a relevant tool proficiency rather than a skill
proficiency.

For example, the DM may allow a player to add their

proficiency with Tinker’s Tools to their attempt to harvest a
mechanical golem or use their proficiency with
leatherworking tools when attempting to harvest a creature
for its hide. Alternatively, all creature type proficiencies may
be replaced by proficiency with the harvesting kit.

Each individual item in a creature’s harvesting table is
listed with a DC next to it. Any roll that a player makes that
equals or exceeds this DC grants that player that item.
Rewards are cumulative, and a player receives every item
with a DC equal to or below their ability check result. For
example, rolling a total of 15 on a check to harvest a
barghest will reward the player with “barghest blood”,
“barghest fur” and “barghest fangs”, but not a “vial of
barghest stomach acid”. If they so wish, players may opt to
not harvest a material even if they have met the DC
threshold to harvest it.

Only one harvesting attempt may be made on a creature.
Failure to meet a certain item’s DC threshold assumes that
the item was made unsalvageable due to the harvester’s
incompetence.

For most creatures, the time it takes to harvest a

material is counted in minutes and is equal to the DC of
that material divided by 5. For huge creatures however, it is
equal in DC of that material, while for gargantuan
creatures, it is equal to the DC of that material multiplied
by 2.

Particularly violent deaths
"It is a shame, but quite understandable, that no one would
want to buy a pelt ridden with slash wounds and burn
marks. That is why lately, I have taken to wrestling my
quarry with my bare hands. It makes for much more
pristine carcasses, and much heartier exercise." - Hamund

This guide assumes that most creatures you attempt to
harvest died in direct combat and thus already accounts for
the idea that you are harvesting creatures that are not in
pristine condition. However, some deaths are more violent
than others and can make harvesting useful materials
either extremely difficult or downright impossible. Such
examples include burning by fire, dissolving from acid, or
being completely crushed under a pillar of stone. In these
cases, raise the DC for harvesting any of that creature’s
materials by 5. Alternatively, the DM may decide that well-
orchestrated hunts result in a carcass that is prime for
harvesting, such as creatures killed mostly through psychic
damage, or those killed in one clean attack. In these cases,
the DM should lower the DC for harvesting any of that
creature’s materials by 5.

Furthermore, the DM may adjudicate whether or not
some of a creature’s individual materials have been made
useless due to effects imposed by them in the course of
their death. Examples may include blood being tainted
from poisoning, or their pelt being worthless due to
excessive slashing/piercing damage.

Optional Rule: Carcass
Degradation
This guide mostly assumes that harvesting takes
place on a freshly killed corpse and that little to
no decomposition has yet occurred. However, in
some cases, a player may desire to harvest a
creature that has been dead for quite a while. In
these cases, the DM may declare that certain
body parts have already withered away and
become unharvestable or may decide to increase
the DC’s of all harvestable materials as if the
creature had died a particularly violent death. If
corpse decomposition is too advanced, it is
entirely within the DM’s right to deny harvesting
the creature altogether.

As a quick guide, the following timeline may be
observed to decide on decomposition levels:

1 hour after death: The carcass’ hide has
ruptured from bloating and has become
useless.
1 day after death: The carcass’ blood has
become too tainted to be useful, and soft
tissues like the eyes have putrefied.
3 days after death: The carcass’ internal organs
have decomposed
7 days after death: The carcass has undergone
extensive purification and none of its soft
tissue remains harvestable.
Note: Harder materials like bones, teeth,
claws, and hair do not generally undergo
decomposition and will remain usable
indefinitely.

Chapter 3: The Harvest Tables

Description
A brief description of the item to be harvested, written by
Hamund. While this is usually just for flavour, some items
also have a “Use” section. These items may be used
immediately after being harvested and require no further
adjustments or crafting. Their function is described here in
the description box.

Additionally, some materials have harvesting

requirements beyond just steady hands and a sharp knife.
Any extra requirements or criteria for harvesting a material
will be listed here.

Value
All materials are listed with their base resell value. This is
how much money an average shopkeeper would be willing
to pay for the materials in good conditions. DM discretion
is advised when varying this value, dependant on
shopkeeper mood, rarity within the setting, condition of the
material, etc. A material with a value listed as “varies”
indicates that its usage is too specific for it to be sold to an
average shopkeeper, and the value of the material would
depend heavily on context.

When items are harvested in discrete quantities, the
value listed refers to each individual item. For example,
Barghest Blood is harvested as a set of 5 vials, and so the
value listed (1 gp) refers to each individual vial (so
successfully harvesting Barghest Blood would be worth 5 x
1 gp = 5 gp). When items are listed as indiscrete quantities
however, the value listed refers to the entire quantity. For
example, Maw Demon Teeth is harvested in the indiscrete
quantity of a: “large bag.” Thus the 1 gp value listed refers
to the value of a “large bag of Maw Demon Teeth,” not 1 gp
for each individual tooth.

Value Factors
The values listed here are based on a myriad of factors
including: CR of the monster, average treasure horde values,
use in crafting, whether the monster tends to be found
alone, whether the item is consumable, probability of
successfully harvesting the item, balance around existing
prices, and sometimes just for flavour. These prices are
intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust
these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is
also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have
high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For
example, although Devourer Skin may be worth the high
price of 2,250 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the village
grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an esoteric
item can be an entertaining side quest in and of itself, or
simply used as a good downtime activity.

Iam aware that in my previous volume, I stated that

I was presenting the complete knowledge of
harvesting all creatures in the multiverse. While it
was true at the time, intrepid explorers other than
myself have discovered even more creatures to
hunt and harvest. While I am ashamed of
misleading my readers, I am humbled by the idea

that even I have more to discover and write about in this
wonderful lifetime of mine." - Hamund

Understanding the Tables

Every unique monster from Volo’s Guide to Monsters has
been listed in this book with an associated harvest table.
When your players attempt a harvest, simply look up the
relevant monster in this guide, and read out the results
(monsters are listed in the same order they are given in
Volo’s Guide to Monsters ). The following is an explanation
of how to read the table.

DC
This is the DC required to harvest this item. Any harvesting
check that equals or exceeds this threshold allows the
player that made that check to succsessfully harvest that
item.

Item
The name of the item received. While for most items, the
player only receives one of the listed item, some item
names have parentheses next to them. These indicate the
amount that a player receives upon a successful harvest
e.g.: Catoblepas Fur (large pouch) or Barghest Blood (5
vials). At the DM’s discretion however, they may adjudicate
that a player receives less or more than the stipulated
quantity. Such reasons may include extremely high success
on a roll, or certain methods in which the creature was
killed.

Optional Rule: Harvesting
Dangerous Materials
Harvesting some creatures are more dangerous
than others. While most creatures are harmless
once killed, others possess poisons, acids, and
breath sacks that remain active even after the
creature’s death. Even worse is that a simple
misplaced knife stroke or errant twitch of the
hand can lead to these materials accidentally
harming the harvester.

Under this optional rule, whenever a harvester
rolls below the DC of a harvestable material that
has a “Use” section that deals damage, the
material is not just lost, it also expends its ability
on the harvester. For example, a character that
fails to properly harvest a poison would suffer
the effect of that poison on themselves, or a
character that fails to harvest a breath sack would
release the effect of that breath sack in their
direction. The exact adjudication of the failure
result may change depending on the DM.

6

Weight
The weight of the item listed in pounds. The weight listed
here follows the same rules as values do; the listed number
refers to the weight of individual items, unless that item is
harvested in indistinct quantities, in which case the weight
refers to the whole indistinct quantity.

Crafting
Some items, although valuable, require a skilled artisan to
craft them into a usable item. The material’s description
details which item they can be crafted into. If this section is
blank, the item has no craftable item associated with it.
The section of crafted items at the end of this book

details the usage of crafted items, as well as details on their
crafting requirements. Some craftable items originate from
published source books from WotC. These receive special
tags in brackets that denote which book they come from.
For more information on crafting visit Chapter 4.

Humanoid Trinket Tables

“While it is still considered rather ghastly practice to
harvest a humanoid, looting their corpses is considered
marginally less so. This is good news, especially since I
have found that the quality of dropped loot has increased as
of late." - Hamund

Most humanoids listed in this book do not possess many

useful materials to harvest. In order to complement the
relatively bare tables of humanoids, a separate table is
listed in their section describing items that may be
plundered off of these creatures. These items tend to be
random trinkets and are not weapons or armour. More
often than not, they are relatively useless and are intended
only to be used for resale.

There is no ability check required to pilfer these trinkets,
and the DM is free to decide which of these trinkets can be
found on a typical corpse (if any at all). These tables are
intended to largely be used as DM inspiration and to sate
the lust of loot-hungry players while avoiding the ghoulish
activity of dismembering a humanoid corpse. New tables
have been provided for humanoids that already appeared in
the Monster Manual. The DM is free to choose which table
they wish to use.

Like all harvested items, the value and weight listed refers to 1 unit of the respective item in that row.

## Harvest Table: B
Banderhobb

“I remember the first time I encountered a banderhobb. A hag had sent one to kill me because I had trounced her in a game of
riddles and took one of her precious jewels as a prize. Now obviously, I prevailed over my hunter, and the only vengeance the
hag achieved was that I ended up having to wash banderhobb goo off my clothes for a week afterwards.” - Hamund

Liquid
Shadow
(vial)

One half of the disgusting components that constitute a banderhobb's vile form
is the rendered flesh of various swamp creatures. When the banderhobb expires,
this flesh loses any sense of cohesion and breaks down into a fetid goo. This goo
still holds some mutagenic properties when harvested correctly, but care should
be used when applying it to anything.
Use: You may spend an action to pour the contents of this vial onto a lizard,
snake, toad, or frog that is no larger than Medium sized. That creature
immediately grows into the giant version of itself (as described in the Monster
Manual) for 1 hour. It returns to its normal size at the end of the hour, or if it
drops to 0 hit points. While under the effect of this item, the creature becomes
violent and attempts to attack the nearest creature it can see whenever possible.

The other half of the components of a banderhobb is liquid shadow, channeled
from a dark realm like the Shadowfell or Underdark. It shifts constantly in its vial
and no amount of light seems to be able to disperse it. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: You may spend an action to pour the contents of this vial over yourself,
merging with the shadows within for the next hour. During this time, whenever
you are in dim light or darkness, you may take the Hide action as a bonus action,
and you may spend an action to teleport, along with whatever you are wearing
and carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of dim light or darkness that
you can see.

Fur

The blood of a barghest is the same color as that of a goblin's, but has a slippery
consistency more in line with that of a traditional yugoloth. It possesses some
transformative properties as is befitting of its status as a shapeshifter.
Use: You may spend an action to drink this blood. If you do so, you polymorph into
a goblin version of yourself for the next hour. Your game statistics remain the same
in your new form, except your size changes to Small. You revert to your normal form
at the end of the hour, or if you die.

Barghests have an odd reaction to fire that transports them back to their home
plane of Gehenna if they are engulfed in it for any period of time. This property
extends to pristine samples of their fur, which can create a portal when used as
tinder. Be warned though, that using said portal will still be quite painful.
Alternatively, it can be used to make a macabre magical doll that is useful for goblin-
based distractions.
Use: If a small bag of barghest fur is thrown into a fire larger than 10 feet high or
wide, the fur is instantly disintegrated and the fire transforms into a portal to a
random location on the plane of Gehenna for the next minute, or until the fire is
extinguished. Anything entering the portal automatically suffers 4d8 fire damage
from the heat of the original flame.

(x2)

The fangs of a barghest are magically imbued and capable of tearing a soul from a
body the way normal fangs tear flesh from bone. While this may seem
incomprehensibly evil, they may be refashioned into weapons that use that very
same property to fight incorporeal undead, thus earning them a little bit of
redemption.

Stomach
Acid
(vial)

Barghests possess an insidious ability befitting of a creature spawned from
Gehenna: they are capable of devouring the souls along with the flesh of those they
kill. While their teeth are responsible for the actual rending of soul from flesh, their
stomachs are to blame for the destruction of the soul itself, their digestive fluids
possessing an unholy property. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: If you pour this item onto a humanoid that has died within the past 10
minutes, that humanoid's soul will begin to be destroyed instead of passing to the
afterlife. It takes 24 hours for a soul to be completely destroyed, after which no
mortal magic may return that humanoid to life. If a resurrection attempt is made
during those 24 hours, the attempt only has a 50 per cent chance of success.
Removing the acid from the body of the humanoid before the 24 hours is over halts
the destruction of the soul. This item has enough stomach acid to destroy one soul,
and stomach acid that has been used once may not be used again.

The crackling blood of a death kiss is as electrified as a field before a storm.
Many foolish adventurers find that their metal weapons turn into conductors
of their own deaths when used to strike a death kiss.

The tentacles of a death kiss lack any ranged capabilities. Instead they are
much more capable in melee combat, being lined with vampiric teeth that can
drain a victim of blood. The hollow teeth of the death kiss served as the
inspiration for the first hypodermic needles, and thus in a strange way,
beholders could be seen as the inventors of this medical breakthrough.

Unlike most beholders, the eye of a death kiss holds no offensive or defensive
abilities. However, when removed, boiled, mashed into a paste, then fortified
with arcane components, the resulting mixture makes a potent medicine used
to treat blood diseases and other maladies. Alternatively, it makes for a
powerful lens to aid in the hunting and tracking of one's foes.

Gauth
DC Item Description

10 Gauth

Stomach

Gauths boast the rather annoying ability to literally consume magic and magical
energy. Some believe that this is related to the magic nullification ability of a
beholder's main eye, but this is still merely conjecture. Either way, allowing a gauth
near your magical sword is a surefire way to end up with a relatively useless hunk of
metal.
Use: You may spend an action to rupture this stomach and spill the contents onto a
magical item, causing it to lose all magical properties for 24 hours, as well as 1d4
charges if it is a charged item. This ability does not function on artefacts or items
with the legendary rarity.

The eye stalks of a gauth are not as powerful as that of a beholder, but they still
have some use when harvested and processed by a skilled artificer.
If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d6. The type of eye stalk they receive
corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the gauth's statblock.

20 Gauth
Main
Eye

The gaze of a gauth differs from a beholder's in that instead of draining magic, the
gauth's gaze drains mobility. Why exactly this occurs is up for debate, but some
scholars have argued it as proof that movement itself is a form of magic (it should
be noted however that these scholars are largely considered crackpots by the
greater scientific community).

Eyestalk

The tiny stalks of a gazer are incredibly difficult to harvest undamaged, and the
wands they create are just as fragile. They are best treated as weapons of last resort
for a mage that is out of options.
If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d4. The type of eye stalk they receive
corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the gazer's statblock.

20 Gazer
Main
Eye

The main eye of a gazer is particularly useful when used in magic, despite its lack of
utility for its original owner. Possessing a small fraction of its beholder-creator's
power, it makes a useful spell component.
Use: When casting the find familiar spell, you may expend this item instead of the
usual material component. If you do so, your summoned familiar takes the form of a
gazer instead of the usual choices. This gazer has all of the normal abilities of a
familiar, as well as its normal abilities as a gazer. This gazer-familiar lasts until it
either drops to 0 hit points or is dismissed.

The infamous mace and skull symbol of Orcus is carved into every bodak's chest,

(vial)

One of the varieties of oil that a boggle is capable of creating, a sticky, tar-like
substance that traps those unlucky enough to step in it. While not the strongest of
substances, it can prove to be quite the nuisance (as anyone with a boggle in their
house will discover after they rise from their chamber pot to discover it sticking to
their backside).
Use: You may spend an action to coat yourself with this oil. For the next hour, you
have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to grapple and any ability check
made to maintain a hold on another creature, surface, or object. You can also climb
difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an
ability check. Alternatively, you may spend an action to pour this oil on the ground,
creating a 5 foot puddle where poured for 1 hour. Any creature that enters that
puddle or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be
restrained. On its turn, a creature can use an action to try to extricate itself from the
sticky puddle, ending the effect and moving into the nearest safe unoccupied space
with a successful DC 11 Strength check.

The other variety of oil that a boggle is capable of creating, a slippery substance that
makes surfaces virtually impossible to traverse. One of a boggle's most reliable
pranks is to simply oil the area around a house's larder, causing anyone entering it to
slip and spill all sorts of foodstuffs on themselves.
Use: You may spend an action to pour this oil on yourself. For the next hour, you gain
advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape bonds, squeeze through
narrow spaces, and end grapples. Alternatively, you may spend an action to pour this
oil on the ground, creating a 5 foot puddle where poured for 1 hour. Any creature
that enters that puddle or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity
saving throw or fall prone.

Harvest Table: C
Catoblepas

“If you are going to hunt a catoblepas, I highly advise you to keep a separate bag for storing the materials. There’s nothing
worse than having to throw out otherwise perfectly good dragon steaks just because they’ve been made unpalatable by the
stench of the catoblepas fur next to them.” - Hamund

DC

Item Description

5 Catoblepas

Milk
(1 gallon)

The pale, vaguely reddish milk of a catoblepas smells worse than it looks. It is
easy to mistake even fresh catoblepas milk as having gone rancid, due to its
incredibly sharp taste and odor. Despite this, it is considerably valuable, as it is
the basis for the gourmet foodstuff: death cheese.

10 Catoblepas

Fur
(large
pouch)

The thick, mangy red fur of the catoblepas looks and feels more like the
decayed vegetable matter that one would find at the bottom of the swamp it
lives in. The unique layout of this fur makes it the perfect trap for bacteria and
disease. While many would thus assume that this fur is a vector for plague, this
very property actually makes it a wonderful filter, and when cleaned and dried
properly can actually be used to make even the most polluted water into
something potable.

15 Catoblepas

Tail

A solid tail, capable of rattling a knight wearing the sturdiest plate. Taken,
treated with oils, and reinforced with steel strips turns this monstrous act of
nature into a deadly weapon on the battlefield.

20 Catoblepas

Eye (x2)

The catoblepas is the natural embodiment of death and decay, and nowhere is
this better exemplified than in their eyes. Filled with necrotic energy rarely seen
outside of the undead, these eyes wither anything they look at, turning fresh
bodies into suitable fare for the catoblepas. Artificers have learned to take these
orbs and transform them into deadly lenses with much of the same ability.

Cave Fisher
DC Item Description

5

Cave
Fisher
Blood
(3 vials)

Cave fisher blood is known not just for being alcoholic, but also being particularly
flammable. In other words, this blood is capable of warming you up one way or
another.
Use: As an action, you may throw this vial at a target you can see within 20 feet of
you as a ranged attack. This vial shatters on impact, covering your target in
flammable liquid. That target has vulnerability to fire damage until the end of your
next turn.

10 Cave
Fisher
Carapace

Incredibly hard and with a strangely attractive milky white tone, cave fisher
carapaces are highly valued in subterranean societies. They have been used for
everything from tools, to armor, to jewelry, and ironically its value has made cave
fishers an endangered species in some areas.

15 Cave
Fisher
Filament
(60 feet)

The notorious adhesive filament of a cave fisher is difficult to extract without
muddling it up into an usable sticky ball. If such a thing is available, it is advised
that you wrap your filament around a bolt of silk cloth, as the filament tends to
have trouble sticking to this material, allowing you to unwind it later with ease.
Once an artificer has gotten their hands on this filament, they can easily turn it
into the ever useful rope of climbing. This fact has made cave fishers particularly
valuable for hunters trying to make some quick cash.
Use: This filament may be unspooled like a regular piece of rope. The filament
sticks to anything it touches, except for silk. A creature that touches the filament
becomes immediately adhered to it. A creature adhered to the filament is
considered grappled (escape DC 13), and ability checks made to escape this
grapple have disadvantage. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points;
immunity to poison and psychic damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it
becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful DC 13 Strength check to
pull free.

Chitine
DC Item Description

10 Chitine
Blood
(vial)

Chitine blood actually has much in common with their drow progenitors, and as such
is just as capable of creating the infamous drow poison. While most chitine do not
have the facilities to transmute their blood into this poison, they become capable of
producing it naturally when they are in their choldrith forms.

15 Chitine

Fur
(small
pouch)

Chitine fur is surprisingly light and fluffy, and if one closes their eyes while touching
it, they would not be at fault for thinking they were touching a duckling's down. This
density is what allows a chitine to sense tiny vibrations in their webs, and good
samples of this fur can help an enterprising adventurer identify these hazards and
avoid them.
Use: You may sprinkle this pouch of fur as an action on any web within 5 feet of you.
This fur will vibrate strongly if a creature comes in contact with the web it is sprinkled
on. Once this fur has been sprinkled on a web, it cannot be removed.

Choldrith
DC

Item Description

10 Choldrith

Blood
(3 vials)

Choldrith blood is even more potent than chitine blood when it comes to
producing the poisonous enzymes that constitute drow poison. As such, choldriths
have become capable of creating their own poison without any external help and
use it on their own weapons.

15 Choldrith

Cranium Rats

“Where you find one cranium rat, you are bound to find more. In fact, due to their hive mind nature, one cranium rat will
instinctually seek out others like it and create a swarm. What I like to do is to leave one cranium rat alive so that it may go
seek the rest of its kind, and then sweep in and bag them all at the same time. While this may end up starting a chain of events
that leads to an illithid invasion, it’s also a very time efficient method of stocking up on harvesting materials.” - Hamund

Cranium Rat
DC Item Description

10 Cranium

Rat
Brain

A rodent brain, permanently altered by exposure to an illithid's psionic energy.
Divorced from life, these brains have an at times unsettling ability to light up when
exposed to the ambient thoughts of sentient creatures. Excavation of illithid colonies
have revealed that some of their hallways have been studded with preserved brains
to lend them proximity based illumination.

DC Item Description

10 Cranium
Rat Brain
(x10)

A rodent brain, permanently altered by exposure to an illithid's psionic energy.
Divorced from life, these brains have an at times unsettling ability to light up when
exposed to the ambient thoughts of sentient creatures. Excavation of illithid
colonies have revealed that some of their hallways have been studded with
preserved brains to lend them proximity based illumination.

15 Swarm

Mentality

When multiple cranium rats swarm together, their latent psionic energy is amplified
and swirls about them, which lingers with each surviving member of the swarm
even as others die around them. An unorthodox application of spirit paper can trap
this potent cloud of psionic energy from the last rat of the swarm to be used later
for whatever purpose. Requires spirit paper.
Use: This item starts with a number of charges equal to the number of rats that
were in the swarm this item was harvested from. If you are subjected to a divination
spell, or any spell that would attempt to either read your thoughts or sense your
emotions while wearing this time on the top of your head, you may spend your
reaction to spend a charge and nullify the effects of that spell. Once the last charge
on this item has been used, it is rendered worthless.

Darklings

“Unfortunately, a slain darkling is not much use in harvesting as their bodies explode upon their death, releasing the light they
have absorbed in one destructive and burning flash. I once had a theory that the light was kept in their torsos, and as such
thought that a limb severed while the darkling was still alive would remain stable. Unfortunately, I was wrong, and all I had to
show for it was a leg’s worth of ash and an understandably irritated darkling.” - Hamund

Darkling
DC Item Description

5 Darkling

Ash
(small
pouch)

The burnt remains of a darkling after its absorbed light has burst out. While it is
disappointing that most of their body has been made unharvestable, the ash still
holds some magical properties as a light nullifier. This should be obvious in that it
was the only portion of the darkling's body to not disintegrate when exposed to a
light flash.
Use: When you cast the darkness spell, you may expend 1 or more pouches of this
ash instead of the usual material components. If you do so, the radius of the
magical darkness you create expands by 5 feet for every pouch of ash you expend.

Elder
Tattoo

The ritual to become a darkling elder is painful, risky, and costly. The enchanted
tattoos contain traces of metals, rare pigments, and magical reagents that are
capable of surviving the light flash that accompanies a darkling's death. It is quite
difficult to do so, but carefully sifting through the elder's ashes can reveal these
tattoo components, which still carry the light they absorbed and are thus
extremely valuable.

DC Item Description

15 Mark
of the
Depths

Despite the fact that a deep scion reverts to its original form upon its death, there is
still a mark of its dark patron that lingers for a moment before vanishing into the
aether. A quick application of spirit paper can trap this essence and reuse it for later,
hopefully for more altruistic purposes. Requires spirit paper.
Use: You may spend an action to tear this item in half. If you do so, all creatures within
300 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until
the end of your next turn. In addition, any creature that succeeds on the saving throw
gains the memories of the last 24 hours of the deep scion from whom this item was

Demons

“More and more demons just keep popping out the woodwork, and still none of them have the decency to leave a valid carcass
unless I slay them on their home plane! I guess that’s the reason they say that fiends are responsible for driving mortals
insane.” - Hamund

Due to their abyssal nature, demons slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcass dissolves into a foul
ichor instead. This ichor serves no purpose and is effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed
in the Abyss.

Furthermore, using parts harvested from a demon comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after
their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a demon part, roll a d20. On a 10 or less, that player
contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only
removed when the player is targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. If a character is cured of a curse caused by an
attunement item, they are not allowed to attempt to attune to that item again. The DM may pick the curse themselves, or roll
for it on the table below.

If the curse came from a non-consumable item, there is an additional aspect of the curse that reads: “You have a constant need
to be within reach of the cursed item and are unwilling to part from it. You feel a need to have it equipped whenever feasibly
possible.”

Fiendish Curse
d6 Curse

1 You feel a rage constantly bubbling under your emotions, threatening to burst at any moment. Whenever a hostile

creature damages you, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must
use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack
action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after your fell your current target. If
you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no
creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

2 An unholy aura surrounds your spirit at all times. While this aura is invisible to any being that cannot see magic

directly, creatures nevertheless feel its effects subconsciously and shun those who bear it. While cursed like this, you
have disadvantage on any Animal Handling check and any Persuasion check made to try to persuade a non-evil
creature.

3 The demonic tinge in your body makes you no different to a normal demon in the eyes of those who hunt them. You
are considered to have an evil alignment regardless of your actual alignment, and your type is considered to be fiend,
along with your regular type. You have disadvantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) check made to convince a good-
aligned creature, and you also gain a vulnerability to radiant damage.

4 Constant whispers fill your mind, confusing your thoughts and weakening your resolve. You have disadvantage on all

Wisdom saving throws.

5 Your fiendish corruption weakens your resolve when fighting against other demons. You have disadvantage on attack

rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special attacks.

6 An unnatural hunger pervades your thoughts and enfeebles your movements. Any time you go more than 3

consecutive hours without eating at least 1 pound of food, make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. The DC increases by 5 for every additional 3 hours you spend without
consuming a pound of food. Both the DC and your exhaustion level is reset upon consuming at least 1 pound of
food.

however, this stomach can be properly harvested and treated to act as a slightly

Shoosuva

Item Description

5 Shoosuva

Fur
(small
pouch)

Shoosuva fur falls in clumps from their bodies, like a dog afflicted with mange.
It is not overly useful or attractive, but demonologists have found that the scent
of this fur tends to make animals more aggressive and violent. Owners of
underground gladiator pits have taken this information to spur their animal
fighters to create more "entertaining" shows.
Use: A beast that has an Intelligence score of 4 or less that smells this fur
within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become
berserk. While berserk, the beast spends each of its turns moving as close as it
can to another creature and attacking it if possible. The beast remains berserk
until it is either unconscious, 1 minute ends, or a creature that the beast is
normally friendly with spends its action to make a Wisdom (Animal Handling)
check with a DC of 15. On a success, the effect ends. A beast that has had the
effect end, or who succeeds its initial saving throw, is immune to the effect of
this item for 24 hours.

10 Shoosuva

Spike

The bony protrusions along a shoosuva's spine are remarkably hard and sharp.
These spines actually grow depending on how well fed a shoosuva is, and the
strongest of them (and thus most able to hunt) have an intimidating frill of
bone down their backs.

15 Shoosuva

Heart

The heart of a shoosuva resembles that of a gnoll who has been "blessed" by
Yeenoghu. Even when removed from its body, it occasionally beats when in the
presence of fresh blood and meat.

20 Shoosuva

The tail of a shoosuva is almost as powerful as that of a bone devil. Loaded with
an insidious poison that leaves a victim helpless, it makes for a wonderful whip
if the poison gland within can be harvested in-tact.

tanned into a set of leather clothes. The fetching hue and its natural warmth make it a
valuable trade good for mountain societies.

6 sp 15 lb.

15 Giant
Strider
Gas
Bladder

A melon sized bladder located just above the giant strider's lungs. This bladder
contains a highly flammable gas that the giant strider uses to kill and cook their prey.
This gas is harvested by firenewts for usage in their alchemy, which often imparts
their potions with the distinctive methane odour of a giant strider's innards.
Use: As an action, you may burst this bladder, spreading a cloud of highly flammable
gas in a 10 foot-foot radius. Any creature within this cloud has vulnerability to fire
damage. The cloud disperses 1 minute after being created, or if it is ignited. This
item may also be thrown up to 20 feet, bursting on impact with the ground.

The sign of a healthy firenewt is a thin layer of mucus on their skin. This mucus
smells of sulfur and other minerals that the firenewts come into regular contact
with, but serves as a wonderful lubricant and insulation material. Tinkers are often
glad to get their hands on samples of this to help maintain their mechanical
inventions.

15 Flail Snail

Slime
Gland

20 Flail Snail

Shell

The eponymous flail tentacles of the flail snail. While powerful when attached
to their body, they atrophy from the enzymes in them when amputated and
become useless. Only a steady hand and reasonable knowledge of snail
anatomy can allow a harvester to slice these off and preserve them long
enough to recraft them into something more useful.

The signature glassy residue left behind by a flail snail as it travels is the
undigested remains of whatever it has eaten. An unruptured slime gland is
particularly valuable as it holds large quantities of unhardened slime that is
more versatile in its liquid form. Aside from various alchemical projects, a
more mundane use is in cosmetics, where the slime can be added to powders
to create a glittery foundation that shimmers like diamonds when applied to
the skin.

The incredibly valuable flail snail shell has numerous uses and seems to be a
gift from the elemental plane. Even the most primitive of societies have
realised the power inherent in these shells, and several tribes have made it a
rite of passage for a trio of youths to hunt a snail and then craft three shields
from the shell. These shields become a bond mark and point of pride for the
three individuals for the rest of their lives.

Froghemoth

“The technical term for a froghemoth is actually “anura maxima.” The relatively lowbrow name “froghemoth” originates from
a bardic play called “Attack of the Froghemoth,” which featured the titular creature as a 50-foot tall, village-crushing force of
nature. The play was extremely popular with theatre goers despite its lack of artistic merit, and so the name stuck around and
has been used ever since.” - Hamund

Item

Description

5 Froghemoth

Foam
(5 vials)

The mucus-like coating that a froghemoth expels whenever it lays an egg
contains a surprising amount of antibiotics and other healing properties.
Most likely this was designed to keep bacteria and disease from infecting
the otherwise uncared for egg. Regardless of its actual purpose, this foam
makes an excellent base for the brewing of healing potions.

10 Froghemoth

Tentacle
(x4)

The four long tentacles of a froghemoth are usually the last things that
swamp dwellers see. Extremely strong along every point of articulation, the
mucus produced along the tentacles also creates a mild adhesive that makes
extricating oneself even more difficult.

15 Froghemoth

Eye (x3)

The eyestalks of a froghemoth are prehensile and have a surprising amount
of acuity. With the application of a little electricity, they can become mobile
again, allowing them to act as independent drones.

20 Froghemoth

Tongue

The tongue of a froghemoth is essentially the same as that of a smaller frog
but on a much larger scale. While the lack of saliva production has resulted
in the loss of its adhesive property, it maintains its extremely strong
snapping action that allowed it to shoot forth and snag prey, as well as a
surprising amount of prehensile control. Particularly crafty tinkers have
realized how to transform this tongue into a ropey weapon attachment that
can give melee weapons a little extra reach and control.

Harvest Table: G
Giants

“It is often a point of contention among scholars on what is actually the taxological difference that separates giants and
humanoids. After all, in many ways the giants are just large humans (or dwarves or halflings or gnomes, for that matter). In my
studies of them however, I have found that a giant’s physiology is extremely malleable, allowing them to either alter themselves
or be altered by environmental factors much more than the average humanoid. Perhaps this is an added feature of the
Ordning, allowing individual giants greater ability to delineate themselves within their caste, or even break free from it
altogether. Either way, it makes for an exciting harvesting adventure, since when you cut one open, you can never be exactly
sure of what you’ll find.” - Hamund

10 Lock of

Resembling an errant nimbus, the hair of a cloud giant is considered a valuable
textile component. Softer than silk and finer than wool, ostentatious mountain
kings may wear vests of these hairs stitched together as both a sign of wealth, and
as an affront to the giants themselves.

15 Cloud

Like all giants, the fingernail of the cloud giant is a key component in brewing the
ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among

only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process
uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength
and thus renders any other attempts moot.

Cloud giant blood exists in a strange transitive state of matter, not entirely gas,

Hair

Resembling the brush on the top of a barren hill, the hair of a hill giant is

unpleasent to the touch, makes for a good rope material and even the hill giants
themselves use it to stitch their clothes together.

15 Hill Giant

Bile (vial)

Like all giants, the fingernail of the hill giant is a key component in brewing the

who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion
can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail
as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders
any other attempts moot.

The stomach of a hill giant is a remarkable thing, able to digest and handle just
about anything. As such, it is a particular point of interest in the rare case that
something actually does manage to give it indigestion. The hill giants believe that it
is a portent of their god Grolantor, while scholars say it is just a stomach flu. Either
way, the hill giant's stomach reacts by producing special enzymes that attempt to
cure the giant, but when digested also send them quite mad. While it may be pitiful
for the giant, this bile can become especially useful if one manages to get their
hands on it, as its uses in magic is quite potent. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: When you cast the confusion spell, you may use this vial of bile instead of the
spell's usual material components. If you do so, whenever a creature that is under
the effects of your confusion spell rolls a d10 to determine their behavior, you may
choose to have them reroll their d10 and you may then pick between the two
results. Using the bile in this way does not consume it, and you may reuse it as
many times as you wish.

The teeth of a stone giant are harder and denser than even the oldest of
boulders. Their molars in particular have been noted to be particularly useful for
stonemasons that wish to emulate the legendary crafting of the stone giants. In
fact, some aging stone giants have even been known to gift their loose teeth to
smallfolk they have grown fond of, in the hopes that they use them to carry on
their legacy.

The brain of a stone giant dreamwalker hardly resembles a brain at all. Signs of
extreme calcification abound throughout the organ, causing it to more
resemble a large piece of pumice. Interestingly enough, the calcification is
most extreme in the areas of the brain known to be responsible for vision,
identity, and decision making. Thus it is theorized by some that the
"dreamwalker" state of the stone giants may actually be some form of disease
rather than a quasi-mystical experience.

Storm Giant Quintessent

15 Mote of

Storm Giant
(vial)

20 Storm Giant
Quintessent
Water (vial)

A storm giant quintessent lacks a stable physical form and is instead
dispersed into the atmosphere around them, swirling as a literal force of
nature. That said, much of their essence can be found distilled into a single
mote of weather. Sometimes this takes the form of sparkling rain drops, a
breeze that carries a whisper of the giant's name, or a snowflake with a
particularly striking pattern. This mote carries much of the original storm
giant's power and is thus a good substitute for their physical remains when
used in alchemical pursuits. Requires enchanted vial.

A storm giant quintessent is capable of forming parts of its own raging storm
into weapons for use in combat. To do this, it must impart the ambient
atmosphere with the same sense of physicality and stability that it has used
on itself to maintain a recognisable giant shape. Once the quintessent is
defeated, some of this imparted power remains in their dispersed weapons,
which can then be hastily collected for use in powerful alchemy later on.

DC Item Description

10 Guard
Drake
Blood
(3
vials)

The blood of a guard drake greatly resembles that of a real dragon, however its
luster is noticeably dulled, and it is much more viscous than the famously free-
flowing dragon blood. While it contains much less magical potential, guard drake
blood apparently smells enough like regular dragon blood to confuse a dragon's
sense of smell, thus giving rise to its use in certain dragon baits/repellents.

15 Guard
Drake
Scales
(small
pouch)

As a guard drake is formed of a dragon's scales, it is no wonder that their own
scales resemble that of their progenitors'. They are however, of a much lower
quality, and are more reminiscent of the smooth scales of a snake than the heavy
plates of a real dragon's. While they are useless for making more guard drakes or
for making armor, they can be used for stylish sets of clothing in the striking hues
of the chromatic dragonflights.

20 Guard
Drake
Heart

A guard drake's heart is one of the only truly magical organs in its body as it
shares an innate connection with the dragon that created it. With a bit of magical
altering, it can be used to track dragons wherever it goes.
Use: If you cast the locate creature spell on this heart once per day for 10
consecutive days, it becomes permanently enchanted and reacts to the presence
of dragons that are the same color as the guard drake from whom this heart was
taken. While enchanted in this way, the heart will begin to beat while it is within
1,000 feet of that color of dragon, with the heart beating steadily faster the closer
that dragon is.

Hags

“By now I hope all my readers are aware of the perils of harvesting hags and the risks of contracting crone’s disease. I advise
for one to place a rag around one’s mouth and nose to minimise the chance of bodily fluid transfer, as well as to block out the
stench of the oft unwashed hag.” - Hamund

Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death.
Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting
“Crone’s Disease.” Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or become infected with crone’s disease. A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest
anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting crone’s disease from splashing blood in an orifice or in an open wound.

Upon contracting crone's disease, 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like.
For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the
saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to
normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7
days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative
magic such as that of the spell greater restoration may return the creature to their normal appearance.

Potion of

Absolutely reeking of the foulness that permeated the hag's entire being, drinking
this blood has the potential to infect a creature with crone's disease. It should also
be noted that while the blood smells and tastes as fetid as it looks, alcohol has a
neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that
information is entirely out of this writer's control.

3 gp 1 lb.

An annis hag tends to have a number of iron teeth that it has embedded in its gums
and magically fused to its own skull. This skull thus possesses strong magical
power similar to the iron tokens that it hands to naïve children, and is thus able to
be exploited by those with artificing knowledge.
Not to be confused with the notorious "hag eye" amulet given by hags to their
servants, however the two are tightly linked. Despite being severed from its socket,
this eye still seems to glare as it did in life.
Use: As an action you may concentrate on the hag eyeball while it is in your hand.

Bheur Hag
DC Item Description

Despite resembling the hoar frost that grows on spider webs, the hair of a bheur
hag is surprisingly supple and flexible. Possessing traces of the hag's ancient frost
magic, these hairs have been repurposed into strings for various inventions,
imparting their wintery power wherever they are used.

Absolutely reeking of the foulness that permeated the hag's entire being, drinking
this blood has the potential to infect a creature with crone's disease. It should also
be noted that while the blood smells and tastes as fetid as it looks, alcohol has a
neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that
information is entirely out of this writer's control.

3 gp 1 lb.

Once removed from its taut, frozen flesh, the skull of a bheur hag flashes a constant
rictus grin. It stares back at whoever gazes at it, mocking them with thoughts of
anxiety and desperation regardless of their current situation. It is dangerous to use
in crafting, but when done well, can create an item that oozes with dark magic and
the slow of winter.
Not to be confused with the notorious "hag eye" amulet given by hags to their
servants, however the two are tightly linked. Despite being severed from its socket,
this eye still seems to glare as it did in life.
Use: As an action you may concentrate on the hag eyeball while it is in your hand.

“So strong is the ki-rin’s compassion for other living creatures, that it can influence their behaviour even after its death. Items
crafted from a ki-rin shine with such magnificence that they can inspire even the lowliest of ne’er do-wells to altruism. I have
seen this with my own hands when a notorious drinking buddy of mine turned his life around after a mere glance at a bundle
of golden ki-rin fur. While I am happy that he has found peace in his life, I do miss having someone to sip whiskey with after a
long day’s journey.” - Hamund

A ki-rin is such a force of good that their body parts are capable of influencing the morality and alignment of those around
them. Whenever you consume or finish a long rest attuned to an item made from a material harvested from a ki-rin, you have a
10 per cent chance of having your alignment changed to lawful good for the next 24 hours. A greater restoration spell or
similar magic will revert you to your original alignment early.

Ki-Rin
DC Item Description

5 Ki-Rin
Blood
(7
vials)

The shimmering, golden blood of a ki-rin flows like and resembles fresh honey.
Wherever the blood spills, plant-life is sure to flourish, which often causes the
death sites of ki-rin to become magnificent gardens in their honor. The vigor
granting properties of the ki-rin's blood is easily mixed into potions and is thus a
valuable reagent for all sorts of restorative potions.

10 Ki-Rin
Fur (7
bolts)

Shining like spun gold, but softer than silk, the fur of a ki-rin is coveted far and
wide for the spinning of clothes worthy of only kings and emperors. Aside from
its use in tailoring, the restorative magic inherent to the ki-rin makes their fur
wonderful for use as a bandage, and ki-rin fur can be found standard in the
healing kits of imperial palaces.
Use: You may choose to use a bolt of ki-rin fur as a bandage whenever you roll a
hit die to recover hit points during a short rest. If you do so, you forgo the roll
and instead gain the maximum value possible from that die. A ki-rin fur bandage
that has been used once may not be used again until it has been soaked in clean
water for at least 8 hours.

15 Ki-Rin
Scales
(large
pouch)

Golden like the morning sun, the scales of a ki-rin are inherently magical and
protect their wearer with magical strength. The scales must be treated more like
the hide of a reptile and be tanned properly in order to be useful, but they make
for a heavenly suit of armor once that is all done.

15 Ki-Rin
Hoof
(x4)

The copper-colored hooves of a ki-rin are much harder than the metal they
resemble. Once reinforced and attached to a sturdy handle, they are capable of
smithing evil even after the demise of their owner.

“Since my last book, I had hoped to be able to say that I had found a specimen of kobold that had managed to impress me.
Sadly, this is not the case. Even though I have seen several other races bolster their forces and grow in strength, it seems that
kobolds have only grown sillier and more of a parody of themselves. A shame really, since they seem so genetically close to the
fiercest creatures in the multiverse: dragons.” - Hamund

Kobold
Teeth
(small

Like a crocodile, kobolds continuously grow and lose teeth throughout their

whites. Kobolds use these for tools and there is no reason why other races
should refuse to do the same if the opportunity presented itself.

Heart

A kobold that bears the title of dragonshield is one that has been touched by a
draconic patron to the heights of kobold potential (admittedly still not much of
an achievement). Their hearts bear slight mutations that add extra adrenaline in
times of stress, allowing them to push on when other kobolds would falter
(again, not that impressive of an achievement).
Use: As an action you may eat this heart or feed it to a willing ally. If the eater is
suffering from a frightened or paralysis effect that would allow a saving throw
to end it, they may immediately attempt that saving at advantage.

Korred

“Once, I very nearly killed a man when I caught him trying to cut off a piece of my beard while I was sleeping. Apparently, the
drunken fool had thought that I was a korred and wanted some of my “magical hair.” How he could have mistaken a proud
dwarf such as myself with an unruly korred, I will never know.” - Hamund

DC Item Description

10 Korred
Hoof
(x2)

A korred's hoof is as sensitive to the earth as a bat's ears are to sound. Small air
pockets inside these hooves allow them to vibrate from the slightest tremor in the
ground and make them surprisingly light. Duergar have been found using these
hooves as tools in their spelunking, but there is nothing stopping the rest of us from
doing the same if we ever find ourselves in the possession of one.
Use: While holding this item against stone or soil, you gain a tremorsense out to a
range of 30 feet.

15 Korred
Scalp

Korred hair is one of the most unique materials in the Multiverse, capable of
transforming into whatever material is used to cut it. If one wants to keep the hair in
its versatile state, there is a relatively grisly workaround: taking the korred's whole
scalp. If you do so, it is advised that one braids the hair before storing it, as the hair
becomes quite brittle and prone to damage upon the death of the korred.
Use: This scalp contains 10 braids of 1 foot in length each. When cut, these braids
permanently transform into whatever material was used to cut it. Once all hair has
been removed from this scalp, it becomes useless.

A leucrota's hide is as odious and oily as a blanket belonging to a wandering

for an excellent rainskin due to its natural oils.

“One of my baggage handlers went missing once during one of my many jaunts through the Feywild. We found the poor lad a
day later, having already succumbed to the torment of a clutch of meenlocks and transformed into one himself. Losing him is
one of my greatest regrets in all my travels, and I think of him whenever I pass by his head, which I mounted on my wall in his
honour.” - Hamund

Item Description

10 Meenlock
Claw (x2)

The meenlock claw is known for its ability to paralyze the creatures that it
strikes. Unfortunately, it loses much of its magical potency upon its death and
is capable of inflicting nothing more than a slight numbing sensation.
Ironically, these claws have been repurposed by Feywild inhabitants as herding
rods to calm over-agitated livestock.

15 Meenlock

Resembling an overgrown ant head, a meenlock's head is truly something to

Use: When you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check while holding this head,
you may choose to do so at advantage. Once this ability has been used 5

“A fun tid-bit about myself: an illithid was in fact the first creature that I had ever harvested properly, so curious was I about the
inner workings (and valuable organs) of these alien beings. The joy I felt in dissecting an illithid (and the money I made selling
off its body parts) is what led me to this lifelong endeavour. So, imagine my joy when I discovered that some illithids had
uncovered the secret to lichdom: an ever-replenishing source of illithids to harvest!” - Hamund

DC Item Description

10 Alhoon

Skin

Due to a lack of mucus, an alhoon's skin is noticeably pale and flakey and can
literally crumble once the alhoon has died. Completely useless for any kind of
leatherworking, crushing the skin into a dust and inhaling it has been known to
induce a psychosis that makes one believe they have died (despite their
breathing and walking around providing evidence to the contrary). For some
strange reason, some people find this experience to be quite cathartic, causing
alhoon dust to be offered in the more exotic entertainment dens.

Brain

As part of an illithid's descent into becoming an alhoon, they must forsake their
colony and elder brain, an emotionally painful act even for the usually indifferent
illithids. To recover from this self-inflicted wound, alhoons erect barriers around
their hearts, both figuratively and literally. With their burgeoning understanding
of magic, alhoons cast spells that numb their hearts and prevent them from
yearning for a colony they may never return to. This magic remains in their hearts
even after their death and yields great benefits when artificing.

The brain of an alhoon is substantially different to that of a regular illithid. Having
severed their connection to the elder brain, the lobes responsible for
communication and community are noticeably atrophied, whereas the sections
related to curiosity and learning have grown. When used in artificing, the result is
substantially different to using a regular illithid's, and instead takes inspiration
from the alhoon's nefarious periapt of mind trapping.

The brain of an ulitharid is larger and denser than that of a regular illithid. Within an

10 Mindwitness

Tentacle
(x4)

A mindwitness' tentacles greatly resembles that of a mind flayer's in terms of

make great whips, but their inferior strength means that they need a bit more
craftwork to become usable.

15 Mindwitness

Eye Stalk

20 Mindwitness

Main Eye

The eye stalks of a mindwitness are irrevocably changed by the corruption of
an elder brain to favor psionic abilities. That said, they are still useful for

be considered even better than a normal beholder's.
If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d6. The type of eye stalk they receive
corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the mindwitness'
statblock.

The main eye of a mindwitness is a pitiful thing to behold (pardon the pun).
Due to the beholder's mutation by the elder brain, its main eye has been
repurposed into an extension of its brain, losing its infamous anti-magic
abilities in the process. Instead, it gains the ability to project thoughts
telepathically into those it can see (thus the name), becoming little more than
a glorified mail carrier for an elder brain's plans. By combining this eye with a
magically enhanced diffraction lens, it is possible to create an item capable of
broadcasting one's thoughts en masse (which is a great tool to have when
walking out of a poorly written theatre performance).

10 Morkoth
Humor

A pearly-white substance found in distilled morkoth blood, this humor is
believed to be derived from the celestial substance that first birthed this bizarre

healing magic, lost in the chaotic spaces of the Astral Plane. As such, it makes
for a fantastic base for particularly powerful healing potions or to bolster one's
healing magic.
Use: When you cast a spell that would result in a creature recovering hit points
without doing damage, you may expend 1 or more vials of morkoth humor as an
additional material component. If you do so, you skip rolling a certain amount of
dice to determine the amount of hit points recovered, and instead gain the

Hatchling
Poison
(vial)

Most likely due to their harsh natural selection that weeds out the weak-willed,
neogi are naturally resistant to any form of emotional manipulation. Biologically,
this comes in the form of an enlarged amygdala that gives the neogi a better "fight
or flight" response than most humanoids and keeps them grounded in reality.
Use: You may spend your action to eat the amygdala. If you do so, for the next hour
you gain advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and
magic can't put you to sleep.

A neogi is deadly even as soon as it is born; it has to be in order to kill all of its
siblings and survive its first day of existence. As part of this, a hatchling comes into
the world with its poison glands fully formed and productive. Funnily enough, this
sometimes results in entire egg clutches dying as the victor of the hatching melee
succumbs to the poison of their defeated broodmates.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one
slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next
minute, any creature successfully hit must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving
throw or take 2d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. A target can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
on a success.

A grown neogi's poison is even deadlier than it was when it was young. Used
for more than just fighting siblings and hunting prey, the poison is also used

their own poison and dilute it into the food they give to slaves in order to
keep them discombobulated and docile..

with a single glare, usually an umber hulk that it chooses to serve as its
muscle. There is currently some conjecture among scholars that the umber
hulk's infamous hypnotizing gaze and the neogi's enslavement glare are
related in some way due to their constant exposure to each other, but there is
little solid evidence to support this, and unfortunately the last scholar that
went out of their way to find some never returned from their expedition.

Item Description

10 Neogi

Amygdala

15 Neogi
Poison
(vial)

20 Neogi
Eye (x2)

Most likely due to their harsh natural selection that weeds out the weak-willed,
neogi are naturally resistant to any form of emotional manipulation.
Biologically, this comes in the form of an enlarged amygdala that gives the
neogi a better "fight or flight" response than most humanoids and keeps them
grounded in reality.
Use: You may spend your action to eat the amygdala. If you do so, for the next
hour you gain advantage on saving throws against being charmed or
frightened, and magic can't put you to sleep.

A grown neogi's poison is even deadlier than it was when it was young. Used
for more than just fighting siblings and hunting prey, the poison is also used
to weaken potential slaves. Neogi slave drivers have been known to extract
their own poison and dilute it into the food they give to slaves in order to
keep them discombobulated and docile..
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or
one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the
next minute, any creature successfully hit must succeed on a DC 10
Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 poison damage and become poisoned
for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Neothelid
DC

Item Description

10 Neothelid
Tentacle
(x2)

A neothelid tentacle is a bizarre mockery of that of an illithid's. Although similar
in many ways, they possess a duct that allows digestive enzymes to be passed
out and onto enemies. This duct is of course useless once the tentacle has
been removed from the neothelid's stomach, but the tentacle itself still serves
as a good weapon base.

10 Neothelid
Enzyme
Sack

15 Neothelid

Brain

The highly acidic contents of a neothelid's digestive tract are capable of melting
through metal and flesh alike. Strangely enough however, it is completely
unreactive when it comes into contact with brain matter. While this does allow
the neothelid to consume their prey's brains intact, it does beg the question of
how they actually end up digesting them once they've been swallowed.
Use: As an action you may throw this sack at a point you can see within 20 feet
of you, bursting on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of that point must
succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 acid damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A neothelid's brain is pitiful in many ways. While it once held the potential for
vast intelligence, it has become extremely limited due to its unnatural growth.
Its psionic abilities however are still extremely powerful and are unchecked by
any semblance of reason or strategy from the creature. In many ways, the
neothelid is simply a tortured creature, given power it cannot control and
perhaps does not even want. When used by an experienced spellcaster
however, this power can be given direction and wielded with much greater
purpose.
Use: When you cast the confusion spell, you may use this brain instead of the
spell's usual material component. If you do so, instead of rolling 1d10 at the
start of an affected creature's turn to determine their behavior, you may choose
the result instead.

Neothelid skin is notoriously difficult to harvest, sloughing off and melting

with their body mucus. If you do manage to harvest some however, their skin
has natural protections against both magic and psionics, and has been adapted
into wondrous armors and protective gear.

25 Neothelid

Hook

As a tadpole, a neothelid would have possessed a hook on the end of its tail to
embed itself into the brain of its unlucky host. As a neothelid of course, it no
longer needs to do this, and its vestigial hook has grown little in comparison to
the rest of its body. Still, the hook possesses some magical ability and when
turned into a weapon and applied properly, can be just as debilitating as it once
would have been when used on a hapless victim.

“My mother taught me never to fight a fool, lest you end up looking like one yourself. This holds especially true when facing

likely won’t be.” - Hamund

DC Item Description

5 Goblin
Ear (x2)

Goblins neither possess much of value, nor are made of anything of value. Goblin
ears are perhaps the only thing worth carving off of an average goblin, if only
because dogs enjoy snacking on them the same way they enjoy pig ears.

10 Mirth

Touched
Smile

Even though a nilbog spirit abandons its physical host upon its defeat, it leaves its
mark permanently in the form of a rictus grin on its old mouth. Mounting this
macabre body part on a base of power can create an amusing novelty wand.

15 Nilbog
Echo

A nilbog's spirit is almost impossible to pin down for even the most skilled
occultists. The most one can hope to do is catch an echo of it using a ream of spirit
paper. This echo is almost as illusive and slippery as the real spirit, and dissipates
too easily to be used for crafting, making it a strictly single use item.
Use: If you cast the sanctuary spell, you may expend this item as a material
component instead of the usual material component. If you do so, the first time the
creature protected by your sanctuary spell receives damage from another creature,
they may spend their reaction to reduce that damage to 0 and recover 1d6 hit
points instead.

The gift of fertility that was granted to the orcs by their deity, Luthic, also gave their

an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the
orcs.
Use: When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10
minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your
speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you
must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of
exhaustion.

A heart touched by the orc god Ilneval beats noticeably faster than a regular orc
heart, sometimes even still beating after being removed from its original owner's
chest. It's almost as if it is still trying to fight beyond death.
Use: You may spend your action to eat this heart. If you do so, for the next hour you
gain the ability to spend your action to allow up to three allies within 120 feet of

A heart touched by the orc god Luthic is noticeably thicker and redder than a normal
heart, perhaps symbolic of the love that orcish parents do show for their children (or
it is reflective of the increased blood flow and strength that these orcs have that
allow them to use their own claws in place of weapons).
Use: You may spend your action to eat this heart. If you do so, for the next hour,
whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points to a creature other than you, that
creature may also spend their reaction to move up to their speed toward a hostile
creature they can see. This benefit cannot be taken by any character with elvish

Quickling blood remains in motion even after it is drained from its body. Thinner
than the blood of any other mortal creature, a quickling's blood is loaded with

has worn off can be rather harsh however.

which you suffer one level of exhaustion.

latter definition as it makes it more justified to harvest them, rather than just “looting” them.” - Hamund

DC Item Description

10 Redcap
Boots

It is difficult to tell where a redcap's feet end and where their boots begin. Since
they never take them off (and are even born wearing them), their feet quite often
fuse into the boots themselves. While this is admittedly quite distasteful to look
at, it does impart an essence of fey magic into metal form (something that is
usually impossible due to the incompatibility between fey creatures and iron).

Regularly soaked in the fresh blood of its victims, the eponymous cap of the

“Despite some similarities in basic anatomy, tlincalli are in fact not related to centaurs. While centaurs are much closer in

The sturdy legs of a tlincalli are just as capable of scrambling up sandy dunes as they
are of marching across miles of baked earth. Once the tlincalli has died however, they
can be quite easily snapped off at the joint and repurposed for a variety of tools.

10 Tlincalli
Chitin

The hard chitin of a tlincalli greatly resembles that of well-forged armor and it is not
uncommon for desert-dwelling societies to proudly wear breastplates made from the
tlincalli they fight. A less well known practice is turning the chitin into boards for
surfing down sand dunes, taking advantage of the chitin's smooth and silica-phobic
properties.

15 Tlincalli

A tlincalli's tail greatly resembling that of an overgrown scorpion's. If steeped in salt-

Poison
(2

A naturally produced poison that the tlincalli use to even to coat their eggs. This
poison is designed to debilitate rather than kill, lending itself well to the tlincalli's
penchant for toying with those they hunt.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of ammunition, or one slashing or piercing
melee weapon. Applying this poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any
creature successfully hit must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6
poison damage on a failed save and becoming poisoned for 1 minute, or half damage
and no poisoned condition on a successful save. If the target failed their saving throw
by 5 or more the target is also paralyzed while poisoned. The target can repeat the

The hide of a trapper is known far and wide for its camouflage capabilities.
Incredibly difficult to remove intact, before it can be tanned, it must also be

Item Description

10 Vargouille

Jaw

The infamous curse of a vargouille is purely magical in nature and unfortunately
cannot be traced back to any biological component for harvesting. That said,
since their jaws act as the vector of the curse, they often become infused with
trace elements of this Abyssal power and thus hold some utility for crafting
fiendish (if ultimately harmless) items.

15 Vargouille
Wing (x2)

Formed from the ears of the vargouille's original body, these wings are
surprisingly powerful and seem to move independently on the vargouille's manic
body. If sliced off quickly after the vargouille's defeat and then pinned with cold
iron tacks, they maintain a semblance of magic that allows them to be reused
elsewhere.
Use: You may spend your action to pin these wings onto an easily pierceable
object that weighs no more than 10 pounds. Once you do so, that object gains a
low level of sentience that allows it to follow you around for 1 hour. The object
has a fly speed of 10 feet and always attempts to take the most direct path to
you, so long as you are within 60 feet of it. If you move farther than 60 feet away,
or if there is an impassible object directly between you and the object, the
object lands on the ground until you move within 60 feet again, or the path to
you becomes clear. At the end of the hour, the wings on the object dissolve into
a black ichor, and the object falls to the ground.

All vegepygmies grow out of a reddish brown spore called russet mold. As they
grow older, their frills begin to produce this mold which accumulates around
their body, waiting to be launched at unwary travelers.
Use: This vial of spores is the equivalent of a square foot of russet mold. Refer to
the russet mold tipbox in the vegepygmy's section to know more about russet
mold's effects.

Thorny
DC Item Description

10 Thorny
Thorns
(small
bag)

Through some unknown system, russet mold is able to detect whether it is infesting a
humanoid or a beast and mutate accordingly. As such, beasts spawn what are known
as a "thorny." A marked difference between a thorny and a vegepygmy is its lack of a
frill, instead growing scores of its eponymous thorns. While quite sharp, they lose their
form quickly once its original owner has died. When mulched however, they make a
fantastic fertilizer (but the resulting plants are known to be considerably more thorny
than they would otherwise).

Harvest Table: W
Wood Woad

“For those that may be uneasy about harvesting a creature as innocent and blameless as the wood woad, never fear. After all, I
am sure that these protectors of the forest are very much in support of the concept of recycling.” – Hamund

DC Item Description

15 Wood
Woad
Bark

Much harder than regular bark and suffused with ancient nature magic, this bark
makes a wonderful set of natural armor. To harvest, it is best advised to use a sharp
knife to make vertical strips down the abdomen of the wood woad, to make splints for
later.

20 Wood
Woad
Eye
(x2)

The eyes of a wood woad are two sparkling motes of light and takes a particularly swift
and practiced hand to extract. That said, they possess significant natural power, and
have most likely seen more than most mortal creatures ever will. Requires enchanted
vial.

25 Wood
Woad
Seed

Despite common belief, the walnut-sized seed extracted from a wood woad is not the
same seed that was implanted in its original heart, and thus cannot be used to spawn a
new wood woad. Instead, this seed acts more like a focus for the wood woad's, and is
able to redistribute its energy into the forest after it has been destroyed. In a way, this
can be seen as the wood woad's last act of dutiful service.
Use: If this seed is planted at least 1 foot deep into loamy, fertile soil, it will sprout into
a magical tree over the course of 1 year. When fully grown, this magical tree stands at
30 feet tall and greatly resembles a sturdy oak. This magical tree acts as a protector of
any surrounding forest area. If a humanoid attempts to harm a tree within 2 miles of
the magical tree, they must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or find
themselves unable to willingly harm any living plant-life for 24 hours. In addition,
plant-life that grows within 2 miles of the magical tree becomes noticeably stronger
and grows at twice its normal rate.

Xvarts

“Pathetic little creatures are the xvarts, however they do have one redeeming feature for the budding harvester: they are all
exactly identical. This makes them fantastic creatures to practice techniques and demonstrate skills on before cutting into
more valuable prizes.” - Hamund

Xvart
DC Item Description

15 Xvart
Tongue

Xvart's are pathetic creatures, possessing little talent or ability. Their one claim of
power is their natural affinity for vermin (if one can even call that power) that lets
them domesticate those beasts the way other humanoids domesticate cattle. This is
helped in part by their tongues which can create the clicks and squeaks that mimic
the calls of bats and rats. When taken, stripped, and dried, they can be used as a reed
in the pipes of haunting.

is helped in part by their tongues which can create the clicks and squeaks that
mimic the calls of bats and rats. When taken, stripped, and dried, they can be used
as a reed in the pipes of haunting.

On rare occasions, the craven demigod Raxivort musters enough courage to visit
his accursed spawn and take what meagre offerings they have for him. On even
rarer occasions, Raxivort will spare some of his power to a follower with the idea
that they will bring him more offerings in the future. As befitting his covetous
nature, he brands his mark onto these followers which can then be taken and used
for minor spellwork.

Yeth Hound

“I remember when I first started learning the art of harvesting, old master Chien gave me an assignment to dissect a fresh
yeth hound he had brought home. I recall him chuckling in the corner as I futilely attempted to cut into it with my scalpel, not
realising that the hounds may only be pierced by silver or magical instruments. Apparently, this is a prank he enjoys pulling on
all of his students, and he never fails to bring it up whenever I visit him for tea.” - Hamund

Due to their nefarious creation, the power of the sun rejects yeth hounds, banishing
them into the ethereal whenever it touches them. This property remains in their fur
long even after their demise and can be reused as a component of particularly dark
rituals.

The mocking bray of a yeth hound is matched by the calls of few other creatures.
When a pack is hunting, these calls echo like a chorus, injecting fear into the
unfortunate victim's mind.

A yeth hound's spine is surprisingly supple for such a large creature, and is not
formed of vertebrae, but instead a single dark rod. When taken and oiled
appropriately, it can be crafted into a bow that fires arrows that hunt down your
enemies with the same relentlessness as the yeth hound itself.

Yuan-Tis

“Exploring the societies of the yuan-ti has been one of my most troublesome ventures thus far. Not only are they extremely
militaristic and isolationist, they live in the most inhospitable, mosquito ridden, disease spreading jungles imaginable. At the
very least, I got a good picture for the cover of this book out of it.” - Hamund

Yuan-Ti Anathema
Item Description
DC

10 Yuan-Ti
Blood
(7 vials)

The blood of a yuan-ti is strange in that it combines enzymes characteristic of
both serpentine and humanoid physiology. This curious property allows unique
opportunities in alchemy for the creation of the perfect antivenom for
humanoids to consume.

15 Yuan-Ti
Poison
(2 vials)

The venom of a yuan-ti combines elements of several of the most deadly snakes
in nature. The poison has been described by survivors like "having one's blood
transfigured into fire."
Use: Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or
one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the
next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw, taking 2d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a
successful saving throw.

20 Anathema

Heart

A yuan-ti anathema constantly emits an aura of fear and loathing that cause
creatures around it to flee. While this ability could easily be chalked up to any
attribute of the anathema, magically speaking, it actually comes from its heart.
Although this ability seems to cease once the heart stops beating, some mad
tinkers have discovered ways to reanimate a heart long after its demise, thus
allowing it to be repurposed as a useful magical trinket.

Sseth, the Sibilant Death, is a particularly insidious god and was responsible for
teaching the yuan-ti the "arts" of traps, poison, and murder. The mind whisperers
that revere him are blessed with his mark (a flying snake with bared fangs) to grant
them the cunning and wickedness to corrupt and conquer.
Use: While wearing this mark, you may invoke its power as a free action to grant
yourself advantage on your next Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion)
check. Once this ability has been used 5 times, this mark crumbles into dust and
becomes worthless.

Dendar, the serpent goddess of nightmares, is revered by the aptly named
nightmare speakers. She casts a pallor over sleeping mortals, inducing nightmares in
them so that she may consume them in her never-ending hunger. Her most devout
priestesses receive her mark so that they may call more nightmares into existence
for her to devour.
Use: You may use this mark in place of the usual material components when you
cast the sleep spell. If you do so, any creature that you successfully put to sleep in
this way also suffers 1d10 psychic damage at the end of every turn they spend
asleep. This damage does not wake up the sleeping creature. Once this ability has
been used 3 times, this mark crumbles into dust and becomes worthless.

The venom of a yuan-ti combines elements of several of the most deadly snakes

Use: Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or

next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw, taking 2d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a

Merrshaulk, the Master of the Pit, was once the prime deity of the yuan-ti
pantheon before he was unseated in some unknown event. He slumbers now,
but still lends his mark (a cobra head) to his most devout followers: the stoic pit
masters. With his blessing, they maintain the traditions of the yuan-ti, whether
that be through diplomacy or by force.
Use: While wearing this amulet, if you are forced to roll a saving throw to resist
being charmed or put to sleep, you may invoke the power of this amulet to
automatically succeed on that saving throw. Once this ability has been used 5
times, this mark crumbles into dust and becomes worthless.

Chapter 4: Crafting

As harvesting evolves, so too does crafting. As

always, I have brought the spoils from my
harvesting adventures back to my crafting
contacts in order to discover what new
wonders can be created. I present them here,
so you too may harness the strength that
nature provides." - Hamund

Crafting Rules

While some creature parts are useful fresh from the
carcass, many require some alterations before their full
potential can be realised. These items can be identified due
to having a craftable item listed in their crafting column.
As crafting is a very natural complement to harvesting, an
entire chapter has been devoted to its rules here.

Crafters
In order to craft a harvested item into a usable item, it must
be worked on by a skilled crafter. Crafters are specialised
professionals with the knowledge to turn raw materials
into something usable. Crafters also tend to be of a certain
type, covering different types of items to be made (see
“Crafter Types” below).

Both player characters and NPCs may act as crafters, so

long as they fulfil the stipulated requirements for their
crafter type.

Crafters also need to have the right equipment and tools

in order to craft an item, however that aspect is left up to
the discretion of the DM and the suitability of the setting. In
more fantastical campaigns, magical forges and
laboratories may line every city bazaar, while in more
grounded settings, finding appropriate facilities may be a
quest in and of itself.

Materials, Time, and Cost
Each craftable item listed in this guide requires at least one
harvestable material from a monster’s harvesting table to
act as a base component of the item. This base component
provides the driving magical force that allows the item to
function. The harvesting material and quantity of the
materials required are listed in the description of the
craftable item. For some craftable items, there are several
potential harvestable materials that may act as the base
component. In these cases, any of the listed materials may
be used.

Craftable items require more than just the base
component provided by harvested materials, however.
Crafting an item requires a cost covering other
requirements such as tools, facilities, and extra materials.
Note that this cost does NOT include the cost of actually
hiring a crafter, and that such a cost is considered separate.
Assuming that the players are providing the base
component for a craftable material, the value of this base
component can be deducted from the end cost of crafting
the item.

Finally, craftable items take a certain amount of time
before they can be completed. The breakdown of the time
and cost investment to craft an item is listed in the Magic
Item Crafting Time and Cost table on the next page.

This guide uses the rules for crafting in Xanathar’s Guide
to Everything as the basis for the crafting rules presented
here. DM’s are encouraged to adjust these numbers based
on the needs of their own games.

Optional Rule: Crafter Skill
Not all crafters are created equal. While a village
blacksmith may be good at fixing scythes and making nails,
if you hand them a dragon scale, the best you will get back
is a ruined dragon scale and an apologetic look. If you have
high quality materials, you're going to need a high quality
crafter.

While under the base rules, anyone can craft anything so
long as they meet the base proficiency requirements, under
this optional rule, crafters are differentiated based on their
proficiency bonus. A crafter may craft any item whose rarity
is equal to or below their proficiency bonus as outlined in
the Crafting Skill Proficiency table on the next page.

Crafter Type
You don’t ask a blacksmith to cut the timbers of your house,
and you don’t ask an alchemist to craft you a suit of armour.
If you want an item crafted, you need the right person for
the job. Each craftable item comes with a tag in brackets
explaining which type of crafter is capable of making that
item.

Crafters are not restricted to a single profession either.
Some skills are complimentary, or certain individuals are
simply talented enough to cover multiple fields. Unless
otherwise stated, crafters with multiple proficiencies use
the same score for each field.

The following is a basic rundown of crafter types:

49

Optional Rule: Crafting Skill Proficiency

Prof. Skill Level

Item Rarity Description

+2 Novice

Common

Usually an apprentice, assistant, or self-taught practitioner. Knows how to use the tools
properly but has little skill with more difficult materials and no ability to make new ideas.

+3 Journeyman Uncommon A craftsmen that serves their village or works in a specific role within their profession.

Knows a few things very well, but most likely would not be able to understand the
complexities of more exotic materials.

+4 Artisan

Rare

The highest level of skill that most ordinary people could hope to attain. Capable of
establishing a good trade in a city or in service of a noble. Experienced in almost all
aspects of their profession and can work with some confidence on rarer materials.

+5 Master

+6 Grand
Master

Very Rare While hard work and dedication is always valuable, only a few people possess the
inherent talent to push the limits of their craft farther than ordinary people. These
talented individuals can be considered masters of their art; capable of not just
reproduction, but innovation.

Legendary An absolute master of their art. Most likely was either an adventurer in their past, or

learned their trade from a supernatural force, as this would be the only way for them to
become accustomed to the legendary materials that they work with. Capable of crafting
any item that falls under their profession.

Alchemist
Alchemy is a profession that deals with the brewing and
mixing of potions, concoctions, and tinctures. In general, if
an organic material needs to be crushed, powdered, dried,
boiled, melted, burned, mixed, etc., it's a job for an
alchemist.

As part of their job, alchemists must also be experienced
herbalists and have some knowledge of creature parts, but
this level of knowledge may vary wildly from alchemist to
alchemist. For example, village alchemists may know how
to mix up local herbs with dried animal parts to cure a cold,
while an elvish grandmaster may have learned the 12
secret uses of dragon blood.

Any character that has proficiency with alchemy tools

may be considered an alchemist for crafting purposes.

Artificer
A catch-all term for anyone who works primarily in the
moulding, transfiguration, enchanting, and manufacture of
magical items. Often powerful wizards, their job requires
them to not only understand magic, but alse be able to
weave permanent spells to transform mundane objects into
wondrous ones. A common practice among artificers
working with harvested materials is to transfigure them
into gems and other objects more conducive to humanoid
wear.

As part of their job, an artificer would have knowledge of

the uses of magical creature parts, spellwork, the use and
preparation of magical reagents (crushed gems, incense,
etc), magical identification, magical history, and basic metal
and woodworking. Of course, not all artificers have the
same level of skill. Some may spend their entire lives mass
manufacturing the same magical trinkets day in and day
out, while others have ventured to far planes and learned
ancient lessons in the courts of djinni princes.

Any character that is proficient in the Arcana skill and
has access to at least one spell slot may be considered an
artificer for crafting purposes.

Blacksmith
A hammer striking anvil, the roar of a heated forge, and the
hiss of cooling metal. These are the sounds of a
blacksmith’s shop, the masters and crafters of metal. While
the job of a blacksmith is usually simplified to a
“metalworker,” the role encompasses so much more.
Blacksmiths craft and fix all manners of equipment ranging
from farming equipment, to weapons, to suits of armour.
Not only that, but while blacksmiths normally deal strictly
with metal, many creature shells, bones, and scales require
metal reinforcement and/or attachments before they can be
used as weapons and armour. As such, even though they
are organic materials, it is still primarily a blacksmith’s
responsibility to craft with them.

Blacksmith skills can vary wildly. The local blacksmith

may only have a small forge from where they repair the
hammers and scythes of their neighbours, while the master
smiths of dwarven kingdoms smelt adamantium in rivers of
magma at the heart of volcanoes.

Any character that is proficient in the smith’s tools may

be considered a blacksmith for crafting purposes.

Leatherworker
Metal armour doesn’t agree with everyone, and many
creatures have perfectly good hides that they won’t be using
anymore. For times like these, a leatherworker is required.
It is a long and messy job to take raw hides, tan them,
preserve them, cut them, and fashion them into armour
and other equipment, but most societies would break down
without this crucial industry.

While leatherworkers are often looked down upon for

their unpleasant job, these are usually just the
leatherworkers that deal with mundane animal hides and
skins. Highly skilled leatherworkers however are treated
with the utmost respect since without them, your skinned
Purple Worm hides would go completely to waste.

Any character that is proficient in the leatherworker’s

tools may be considered a leatherworker for crafting
purposes.

50

Tinker
Tinkers are a rare profession, but their work possesses
incredible value. Tinkers are usually associated with
finnicky contraptions and devices, and if they ever use
magic it is usually more of an energy source rather than the
driving characteristic. Really, tinkers are more concerned
with finding new materials with strange properties to
experiment with, and their inventions can range from the
entertaining to the absolutely revolutionary.

With that in mind, tinkers vary widely in skill. A travelling

peddler may have some experience in making mechanical
puppets that flail around for the amusement of children,
while the daring few that have travelled to Mechanus and
returned alive may have unlocked the secrets of artificial
life.

Any character that is proficient in the tinker’s tools may

be considered a tinker for crafting purposes.

Thaumaturge
When a piece of armour needs the blessings of a god, or a
sword needs a spirit coaxed into it, a thaumaturge is
needed. These specialised crafters usually do not consider
themselves crafters at all, but simply people with special
connections to the gods and their divine energy.
Thaumaturges are not limited to just those that worship
the gods either, many fiendish cults can boast their own
specialised thaumaturge members that craft their cursed
daggers and bind damned souls into pieces of jewellery.

As strange as it is to say, the gods do not see everyone as
equals, and certainly do not apportion their gifts
impartially. A vagrant holy man is probably capable of
invoking his god’s name to create a few vials of holy water,
while a high cleric of Moradin would be able to bless a
hammer so that it strikes with the same fury as their
furious deity.

Any character that is proficient in the Religion skill has
access to at least one spell slot, and is a follower of a deity
or otherworldly patron, may be considered a thaumaturge
for crafting purposes.

Crafting Items from Published
Books
Some craftable items originate from official source books
published by Wizards of the Coast. In order to avoid lifting
large sections of their book and reproducing them here,
you are encouraged to look them up in their original books.
The source book has been tagged next to the craftable
item’s name: PHB for Player's Handbook, DMG for
Dungeon Master’s Guide, and XGTE for Xanathar’s Guide
to Everything.

order. A craftable item's description gives the
item's name, its category, its rarity, its base
component, the crafter type required to make
it, and its magical properties.

Craftable items are presented in alphabetical

Amulet of Dragonkin
Wondrous item, common
Crafted by: Guard Drake Heart x1 (Artificer)
This amulet is the same color as the guard drake from
whom it was crafted. While wearing this amulet, your
appearance takes on a more dragon-like aesthetic. You
grow patches of scales over your body (the same color as
the amulet), your eyes become lizard-like, your teeth grow
sharper and you grow a foot-long, prehensile tail from your
back. You gain no other benefits from this amulet, however.
All these attributes disappear instantly if the amulet is

removed.

Amulet of Enslavement
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Neogi Eye x1 (Artificer)
While you are wearing this amulet, any charm effect that
currently afflicts you is considered to have an infinite
duration instead of its usual duration. Once this amulet has
been worn for a cumulative total of 24 hours, it crumbles
into dust and becomes worthless.

Amulet of Imix
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Mark of Imix x1 (Thaumaturge)
While wearing and attuned to this amulet, you gain 5
temporary hit points whenever you reduce an enemy to 0
hit points. In addition, any time you are forced to roll a
Constitution saving throw to maintain control of a fire
elemental or maintain concentration on a spell that deals
fire damage, you do so at advantage.

Amulet of Telepathic Control
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Telepathic Gland x1 (Artificer)
While wearing this amulet, you gain the following abilities:

You have telepathy out to a range of 1 mile
You are aware of the presence of creatures within 100
feet of you that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher.
You know the distance and direction to those creatures
but can’t sense anything else about them.
You may cast the dominate monster spell without
requiring any components or using any spell slots. Once
this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again
until the next dawn.

Amulet of the Closed Heart
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Alhoon Heart x1 (Artificer)
While wearing this amulet, you are immune to magic that
allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine
whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your
creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate
with you only if you allow it.

In addition, you gain the ability to spend your action to
create a pulse of emotionally dampening mental energy in
a 30-foot radius around yourself. Any creature in that
radius that is under a charm or fear condition that would
end on a successful saving throw may immediately attempt
that saving throw, adding your Intelligence modifier in
addition to their normal modifiers.

Amulet of the Forest
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Wood Woad Eye x2 (Artificer)
This green amulet possesses two sparkling motes of light
inside of it. While wearing this amulet, you may spend 1
minute focusing on a living tree within 5 feet of you. If you
do so, you gain an innate bond with that tree that lasts for
the next 24 hours. This bond grants the tree a low level of
sentience, similar to the speak with plants spell, with the
additional bonus that you and the tree may communicate
over any distance so long as you are both on the same
plane of existence. You may also spend your action to
experience what the tree is experiencing until the start of
your next turn, during which you are deaf and blind
regarding your own senses.

In addition, you may spend 10 minutes focusing on a
square patch of soil that is 5 feet on each side. At the end of
that 10 minutes, a tree magically grows from that patch of
soil. The tree has a diameter of 5 feet and grows until it is
20 feet tall or reaches a solid object above it, whichever
comes first. You automatically have an innate bond with
this tree, and it disappears automatically 24 hours after it
has been created. You may only have one of these trees at a
time, attempting to create a new one while another already
exists causes the earlier one to disappear early.

Amulet of the Mind Flayer
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Mind Flayer Heart x1 (Artificer)
While you are wearing this amulet, you may spend an
action to designate up to 4 willing creatures within 30 feet
of you as your thralls. So long as you and your thralls are
on the same plane of existence, you may communicate with
them telepathically. In addition, so long as you and at least
one of your thralls are within 30 feet of each other, you both
gain advantage on Intelligence saving throws, and if you
suffer psychic damage, you may spend your reaction to
force your thrall to suffer some, or all of that damage
instead of you. You may only have up to 4 creatures as your
thralls at a time. If you wish to add a new creature, you
must spend an action breaking your connection to one of
your old ones first. Curse: Using this amulet is a dangerous
proposition due to its incredibly vile origins. Attuning to
this amulet curses you until you are targeted by the remove
curse spell or similar magic; removing this amulet fails to
end the curse. While cursed, you automatically fail on
saving throws imposed by members of the illithid race,
including elder brains and intellect devourers.

Anathema Device
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Anathema Heart x1 (Tinker)
This yuan-ti heart is encased in a complicated contraption
of copper wires and other mechanical pieces. You may
spend your action to activate this contraption, causing it to
shock the heart and forcing it to beat. So long as the heart
is beating, you emit an aura of fear in a 30-foot radius circle
centered on yourself. Any creature of your choice that starts
their turn in that circle must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute of any
member of your race. A frightened target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw is
successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to
this aura for the next 24 hours.

The heart remains beating for 1 minute, or until you drop

it from your hand. Once this item has been used once, it
cannot be used again for 24 hours.

Antimagic Shield
Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Flail Snail Shell x1/3 (Blacksmith)
While wearing this shield, you have advantage on saving
throws against spells, and any creature making a spell
attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If
you succeed on your saving throw against a spell, or if a
spell attack misses you, an additional effect might occur, as
determined by rolling a d6:

1-2: If the spell affects an area or has multiple targets, it
fails and has no effect. If the spell targets only you, it has
no effect on you and is reflected back at the caster, using
the spell slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and
spellcasting ability of the caster.
3-4: No additional effect.
5-6: The shield converts some of the spell's energy into a
burst of destructive force. Each creature within 30 feet
of you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw,
taking 1d6 force damage per level of the spell on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

This shield loses all its magical properties 1 month after
being crafted. After this point, the shield may be reused to
create a spellguard shield, counting for 2,000 gp of the
crafting cost.

Armor of the Forest Sentinel
Armor (splint), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Wood Woad Bark x1 (Artificer)
Despite being made entirely of bark, this set of armor
possesses the same attributes as a normal set of splint
armor.

In addition, while wearing this armor, you may cast the
tree stride spell once per day without requiring any spell
components or spell slots.

Bag of Colding
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Frost Giant Tongue x1/4 (Leatherworker)
This bag has a permanent enchantment on it that causes
any organic material inside it to be kept in a state of
preservation as if it had the spell gentle repose cast upon it.
This effect wears off as soon as the item is removed from
the bag, and the bag must be completely closed in order for
its ability to function. The bag is capable of holding up to 3
cubic feet of material inside it and its opening can open up
to 1 foot in diameter.

Bewildering Bagpipes
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Grung Bladder x1 (Tinker)
This set of bagpipes creates a sound similar to that of a
grung’s chirr when used. If a bard uses this instrument as a
spellcasting focus while attempting to a spell that would
impose the charm condition on a target, the range of that
spell is doubled.

Big Catch Hooks
Wondrous item, common
Crafted by: Sea Spawn Teeth x1 small bag (Artificer)
This set of 10 hooks are carved from sea spawn teeth and
may be attached to any standard fishing rod. Any fish within
10 feet of this hook that can see it must succeed on a DC
10 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the hook for 1
minute.

While charmed in this way, the fish must spend their

movement each turn moving as close to the hook as
possible, and their action to bite onto the hook if they can
reach it. A charmed fish may attempt the saving throw
again at the end of each of its turns or whenever it takes
damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. A fish that
succeeds on their saving throw is immune to the effect of
this hook for 24 hours.

Bite of Varpak
Weapon (any piercing or slashing weapon), very rare
(requires attunement)
Crafted by: Mark of Varpak x1 (Thaumaturge)
As a bonus action, you may activate this weapon. It remains
active for 1 minute or until you deactivate it as another
bonus action or drop it. While activated, any successful
attacks made with this weapon deal an extra 1d6 acid
damage. In addition, whenever you make a successful
attack against a creature made of flesh, you heal an amount
of hit points equal to the amount of acid damage dealt by
this weapon.

Curse: While attuned to this weapon you are cursed.
While cursed in this way, you cannot voluntarily end your
attunement to this weapon and the amount of food you
require to eat per day is doubled. If you spend a day without
eating this amount of food, you automatically gain one level
of exhaustion and have a 25 per cent chance of gaining a
troll-like mutation such as: discolored skin, warty scars, or
vestigial body parts. Casting the remove curse spell on you
or this weapon ends the curse and breaks your attunement
to this weapon. However, it does not end any of the
mutations you may have gained, which may only be
removed if you are targeted by the greater restoration spell
or similar magic.

Bloodhunter’s Lens
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Death Kiss Main Eye x1 (Artificer)
While wearing this crimson monocle lens, you may activate
it by spending your action to speak its command word.
While activated, the blood of all creatures within 60 feet of
you appear as an extremely bright, red light. You can see
this blood even if it is fully obstructed (such as from being
within a creature’s body or behind a wall), in darkness, or
invisible. You may deactivate the lens at any time by
speaking its command word again as an action.

The lens can be activated for 1 hour, all at once or in
smaller increments, using a minimum of 1 minute each
time it is activated. The lens regains 10 minutes of use for
every 6 hours it is not in use.

Boots of Iron Gait
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Redcap Boots x1 (Blacksmith)
While wearing these boots, you have disadvantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and if you are ever subjected to
an effect that would move you against your will, you may
spend your reaction to instead not move so long as you are
standing on solid ground.

Boots of Stone Strength
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Korred Hoof x2 (Artificer)
These hard-toed boots grant their wearer the sturdiness of
the earth itself. While wearing these boots and standing on
either stone or soil, you gain the following benefits:

You gain a tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.
If you are subjected to an effect other than gravity that
would attempt to move you against your will, you may
spend your reaction to instead not move.
You ignore any penalties to your movement speed that
would be imposed by walking over non-magical stone or
soil.

Breastplate of the Boundary
Armor (breastplate), very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Devourer Ribcage x1 (Thaumaturge)
While wearing and attuned to this breastplate, you
constantly teeter on the boundary between life and death.
You have resistance to necrotic damage, and if you end
your turn with 0 hit points, you regain 1 hit point. In
addition, you are immune to any spell or ability that would
attempt to kill you instantly without dealing damage,
instantly reduce you to 0 hit points without dealing
damage, or attempt to remove your soul from your body
without your consent (except for the curse described
below).

Curse: Attuning to this armor curses you until you are
targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic which
ends your attunement; removing the armor fails to end the
curse. While cursed, the amount of death saving throw
failures required to kill you is reduced by 1. In addition, if
you die while wearing this armor, your soul is consumed by
the breastplate and is instantly transported to Orcus to do
with as he wishes. Your corpse is transformed into a
devourer on full hit points which is hostile to any creature
around it. Resurrection magic automatically fails when cast
on you, unless your soul is first removed from Orcus’
possession, after which a resurrection spell may be cast on
your devourer corpse which will transform back into your
original body.

Camouflage Cloak
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Trapper Hide x1 (Leatherworker)
You may cover yourself with this cloak as a free action
while pressing yourself flat against a hard, uniformly
colored surface. If you do so, your cloak changes to match
the color of the surface you are pressed against, giving you
advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make while
remaining motionless against this surface.

Cap of Aggression
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Redcap Cap x1 (Artificer)
While wearing this cap, you may spend your bonus action
to designate a creature within 60 feet of you that you can
see and that has blood in their body as your quarry. As part
of your Attack action, you may choose to move up to your
speed in the direction of your quarry. In addition, the first
successful melee weapon attack you make against your
quarry on your turn deals an extra damage dice of damage,
and the same applies to your quarry’s first successful melee
weapon attack against you on their turn.

You may only have one quarry at a time and any attempt

at designating a new target as your quarry while you
already have a quarry automatically fails. A target remains
your quarry until you bathe this cap in fresh blood from
their corpse for at least 1 minute or if 24 hours pass since
you last designated a quarry.

Cleric’s Bane Poison
Poison, rare
Crafted by: Yurtrus Ichor x1 vial (Alchemist)

Cloak of the Storm Spirit
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Storm Giant Spirit x1 (Leatherworker)
This electric-blue cloak emanates a constant low hum of
the sound of thunder. While wearing and attuned to this
cloak, you have resistance to lightning and thunder
damage. In addition, you may spend your action to speak
the cloak’s command word and transform yourself into a
living storm for 1 minute or until you spend your action to
speak the command word again.

As a living storm, you lack a corporeal form and are
instead a vague humanoid shape roughly the same height
as your original form and made of lightning, clouds, and

during this time and reappears once you transform back
into your true form. As a living storm, you gain the

have resistance to nonmagical attacks.

damage.
You have a flying (hover) and swim speed equal to your
walking speed.

wide without squeezing. You may also enter a hostile
creature’s space and stop there. The first time you enter
a creature’s space on a turn, or if a creature starts their
turn in a space occupied by you, that creature takes 2d6
lightning damage.

If you are in living storm form while in an area under the

effect of the control weather spell or similar magic, you
instantly revert to your true form. Once this item’s ability
has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next
dawn.

Cloud Step Oil
Oil,very rare
Crafted by: Cloud Giant Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)
When some of this oil is poured out, it immediately has a
reaction to the air around it and magically expands into a
semi-solid cloud that is capable of floating while holding
weight on top of it. Up to 50 pounds of weight per square
foot can be placed on one of these clouds. If more weight
than this is placed on it, that section of cloud disappears
instantly. Clouds are self-supporting in the air but can also
be used to make structures such as bridges using careful
placement of the oil. Clouds weigh virtually nothing and
can be moved around if external force is applied to them.
The clouds last for 1 hour after pouring, after which they
disappear. One bottle of this oil is enough to create 500
square feet of clouds.

Corruption Skull
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Annis Hag Skull x1 (Artificer)

spell without using any components.

Once per day, when you cast message in this way, you
may also choose to force your target to succeed a DC 13
Charisma saving throw or become charmed by you for the
next 24 hours. While charmed in this way, their alignment
changes to evil, and any Persuasion (Charisma) checks you
make to convince them to perform an evil act is rolled at
advantage. The charm ends after 24 hours, or if you do
anything to directly harm the charmed creature.

around you that deals 5 necrotic damage to any creature
that ends its turn within 10 feet of you. Undead and fiends
ignore this aura."

the remove curse spell or similar magic is cast on either
you or the cursed item.

you as a free action, or if the creature remains out of your
line of sight for 24 hours.”

Death Goggles
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Bodak Eye x2 (Thaumaturge)

target a humanoid within 30 feet of you. If that humanoid is
unwilling, they may make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw to
avoid the effects of this item. If they are willing, or if they
fail the saving throw, you immediately gain the targeted
humanoid’s memory of the most recent time in which they
killed another humanoid. If that killing happened within the
past 24 hours, they also suffer 2d10 psychic damage.
If the targeted humanoid has never killed another
humanoid, you instead become blinded for 1 minute.

Demon Vellum
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Babau Skin (Leatherworker)
This ashy grey vellum is crafted from the skin of a demon
and is capable of summoning other demons when it is used
to channel words of power. A wizard may choose to
inscribe one of their known spells on this sheaf of vellum
and insert it into their spellbook. If they do so, whenever
they cast that spell, they may cast it as if they had cast it
using the highest spell slot level their wizard level would
grant them, regardless of the level of the spell slot they
actually used.

However, whenever that spell is cast in this way, there is

also a 10 per cent chance that a demon will appear in an
unoccupied space adjacent to the caster. This demon is
chosen by the DM but must be of a Challenge Rating equal
to or below the spell level that the triggering spell was cast
at. This demon acts on its own initiative and is hostile to all
non-demons around it but will prioritize attacking the
caster if possible. The demon disappears after 1 minute, or
if it drops to 0 hit points, whichever comes first.

points, is immune to psychic and poison damage, and has

item has been deactivated, it cannot be used again for 24
hours.

Flask of Storms
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Storm Giant Quintessent Water x1 vial
(Alchemist)
This item takes the form of a grey-blue liquid inside a vial
roughly the size of a weapon hilt. While holding the flask,
you may spend a bonus action to imagine a non-two-
handed melee weapon. If you do so, the liquid inside this
flask pours out and takes the shape of the weapon you
imagined, attaching itself to the flask which acts as the
weapon’s hilt. This weapon may be used like any other
weapon, and attacks made with it are considered magical.
Once per turn, when you make a successful attack with this
weapon, you may also deal an additional 2d6 lightning
damage. You may also shape the liquid into an object that is
not a weapon, so long as that object is no larger than 1
cubic foot in volume. The liquid returns to its flask if it is

it to mentally command it to do so.

cover 30 square feet of glass.

Goblin Effigy
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Barghest Fur x1 small bag (Thaumaturge)
This basic cloth doll is woven from long strands of barghest
fur and resembles a caricature of a goblin. When you speak
the command word within 10 feet of this doll, it grows into
a semi-aware goblin whose basic appearance you choose.
This goblin superficially resembles a goblin but is unable to
speak, communicate meaningfully, or change its emotions
from anything but a blank stare. It has a walking speed of
10 feet, a Strength and Dexterity score of 8, an AC score of
9, and 6 hit points. It is unable to take any actions except
for the Dash, Hide, and Use an Object actions. The goblin
is loyal to whoever spoke its command word and does its
best to follow their orders. After 1 hour, or if it is reduced to

Harp of Winter’s Tempo
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)
Crafted by: Bheur Hag Hair x1 small pouch (Tinker)
You may spend your action to play this harp. If you do so,
you may roll any number of your available Bardic
Inspiration dice to target an equal number of creatures
within 60 feet of you that can hear you. Until the end of the
next round, those creatures have a penalty to their initiative
score equal to the number you roll on your Bardic
Inspiration dice, making separate rolls for each target. If
this penalty causes a creature to fall below you in the
initiative order, they do not get a new turn and that turn is
instead skipped.

Heart Scales
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Ki-Rin Heart x1 (Thaumaturge)
This set of golden scales has an unremovable petrified
heart placed on one side. If a body part of a creature (such
as a lock of hair, bit of nail, etc.) is placed on the other side,
this scale judges that creature’s character and alignment. If
that creature has an evil alignment, the scales will tip
towards the body part. If that creature has a neutral
alignment, the scales will remain balanced. If that creature
has a good alignment, the scales will tip towards the heart.
If you are holding this item, you may focus on it while it

has a creature’s body part on the scale. So long as you
remain in contact with this item, you automatically succeed
any Wisdom (Insight) checks made against the creature
whose body part is on the scale.

Helm of Mind Trapping
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Alhoon Brain x1 (Artificer)
While wearing this helm, you may spend your action to
force a target humanoid within 30 feet of you that you can
see to make a contested Intelligence check against you. If
the target succeeds, the ability of this item fails, and they
become immune to its effects for 24 hours. If you succeed,
you store a copy of their mind inside the helm that
possesses the target’s memory and personality at the time
of the copy being made. While wearing the helm you may
communicate with this copy telepathically and access any
of their memories. In addition, you gain any skill and tool
proficiencies that target had, however you use your own
proficiency bonus. If the target was a spellcaster, you add
all of their known spells to your own spell list, so long as
they are on a class spell list and of a spell level that you
have access to.

The helm may only store one copy of a mind at a time.
This copy is only removed if the helm is destroyed or if the
wearer makes a copy of a different humanoid’s mind. The
wearer may also choose to make a copy of their own mind
while wearing the helm (no check required).

Helm of the Cryptkeeper
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Spawn of Kyuss Brain x1 (Artificer)
While wearing this helm, you may spend your action to
target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of
you that has an Intelligence score of less than 10. That
undead creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving
throw or become your servant for 1 minute. While an
undead creature is your servant, you may issue simple
commands to them while you are conscious through a
telepathic link you share (no action required), so long as
you are both on the same plane of existence. A simple
command is a general course of action such as “Attack that
creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the
creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further
direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the
best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control

of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature
takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything
that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also
cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you
to use your own reaction as well.

Each time your servant takes damage, it may make a new

Wisdom saving throw against this effect, ending it on a
success. You may only have one servant at a time.
Attempting to make another undead creature your servant
instantly causes this effect to end on your old one. An
undead that has successfully saved against this ability is
immune to this item for the next 24 hours.

Helm of the Ulitharid
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Ulitharid Brain x1 (Artificer)
While wearing this helm, you have telepathy out to a range
of 120 feet. In addition, you may spend an action to
magically emit psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each
creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence
saving throw or take 4d12 psychic damage and be stunned
for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be
used again until the next dawn.

While wearing this helm you also mentally receive
duplicates of any messages sent or received via telepathy
by creatures within 30 feet of you. The original sender and
receiver are not made aware of this interception, and you
cannot telepathically respond to a duplicated telepathic
message.

Helmet of Stone Dreams
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Stone Giant Dreamwalker Brain x1 (Artificer)
This stone helmet resembles the petrified brain of a stone
giant. If you spend your action picturing an item no larger
than 1 square foot. While wearing and attuned to this item,
a stone version of that item appears in an unoccupied
space within 5 feet of you. This stone disappears after 1
hour, or if it is destroyed. Once you have created 5 items in
a day using this ability, you may not use it again until the
next dawn.

Leeching Whip
Weapon (whip), rare
Crafted by: Death Kiss Tentacle x1 (Tinker)
When you hit a Huge or smaller sized creature with this
weapon, you may make a grapple check against them as a
free action, using this whip to grapple instead of your free
hand. While you have a creature grappled in this way, you
may not attack with this weapon. If you have a creature
grappled by this weapon, you may spend an action to force
that creature to succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving
throw or suffer 2d10 necrotic damage. In addition, if a
creature fails their saving throw, a vial’s worth of their
blood becomes stored in the whip, which you may harvest
as an action without requiring a check. This whip can only
store one vial’s worth of blood at a time.

Lenses of Hypnosis
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Morkoth Eye x2 (Artificer)
While wearing these lenses, you may spend an action to
project a 30-foot cone of magical energy. Each creature in
that area must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute.
While charmed in this way, the target tries to get as close to
you as possible, using its actions to Dash until it is within 5
feet of you. A charmed target can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage,
ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used

again until the next dawn.

Horn of Fear
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Yeth Hound Voice Box x1 (Tinker)
You may spend your action to blow this hunting horn,
emitting a baleful bray that can be heard up to 150 feet
away. Any creature other than you that can hear this bray
must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be
frightened until the end of your next turn. A frightened
creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of you must use
all of its movement on that turn to get as far from you as
possible, must finish the move before taking an action, and
must take the most direct route, even if hazards lie that
way. A target that successfully saves is immune to the effect
of this horn for 24 hours.

Each time you blow this horn, there is a cumulative 5 per

cent chance that it will break apart and become useless.

Idea Bulb
Wondrous item, common
Crafted by: Cranium Rat Brain x1 (Tinker)
This morbid looking glass bulb contains the preserved
brain of a cranium rat. When a creature with an
Intelligence score of 6 or higher comes within 10 feet of
this item, it will light up, shedding dim light in a 5-foot
radius. If 5 of these bulbs are grouped together, the light
increases to a bright light in a 10-foot radius, with another
10 feet beyond that of dim light. If 5 of these bulbs are
grouped together, the light increases again to a bright light
in a 30-foot radius, with another 20 feet of dim light beyond
that.

A creature that comes within 10 feet of this item for the

first time in a turn may mentally command them to not
react to their presence until they mentally command them
to react to them again.

Ink of Secret Knowledge
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Alhoon Tentacle x1 (Alchemist)
A character with at least 1 level in the Wizard class may
use this ink to re-scribe one of their known spells into their
spell book. If they do, they may choose to cast that spell
using the power of their mind instead of traditional means.
Casting a spell in this way does not require any
components, unless it is a material component with an
associated cost.

Interrogator’s Web
Weapon (net), rare
Crafted by: Elder Brain White Matter x1 (Leatherworker)
This large net is composed of the web-like connective
tissue of an elder brain. If there is a creature caught in this
net, you may spend your action holding onto the net and
focusing on that creature. If you do so, you gain one
memory or fact from that creature’s mind. The memory or
fact may be one that you specifically search for, otherwise
you gain a random one chosen by the DM.

A creature may use its action to make a DC 20 Strength
check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on
a success. Dealing 20 slashing damage to the net (AC 15)
also frees the creature, ending the effect and destroying the
net.

Mask of Clouds
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a bard
or trickster domain cleric)
Crafted by: Smiling One Mask x1 (Thaumaturge)
This two-faced mask has been imbued with divine energy
siphoned from a cloud giant smiling one mask.

While wearing and attuned to this mask, your illusion

spells gain a particular potency. Whenever you cast an
illusion spell that creates an image, that image becomes
physical and emulates the feel, texture, and weight of the
real object it is imitating; this allows your images to
withstand physical inspection. However, if more than 10
pounds of force are applied to your image, it will burst into
a thick, cloud-like fog and then quickly dissipate, thus
revealing it as an illusion.

Mind Hook, +1
Weapon (war pick or sickle), very rare (requires
attunement)
Crafted by: Neothelid Hook x1 (Blacksmith)

Crafted by: Mindwitness Tentacle x4 (rare), Ulitharid
Tentacle x6 (rare), Elder Brain Tentacle x2 (very rare)
(Leatherworker)
When you make a grapple check, you may choose to do so
with this whip instead of using your free hand. If you do so
and if you succeed on the grapple check, you may force the
grappled creature to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence
saving throw or be stunned until the grapple ends. While
grappling a creature, this whip may not be used to attack
another target. Once this ability has been used 4 times in a
day, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

If you are using the very rare version of this weapon, you
also have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
this weapon.

Lesser Eye Stalk Wand

environment in which fire is capable of burning.

4. Slowing Ray: The targeted creature must make a DC 13

Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s

move it up to 30 feet in any direction, and it is restrained
by the ray’s telekinetic grip until the start of your next
turn or until you are incapacitated. If the target is an
object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn
or carried, it is telekinetically moved up to 30 feet in any
direction. You can also exert fine control on objects with
this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a

then dim light for 15 feet beyond that, and any damage
dealt using that item may be treated as radiant damage
instead of its usual damage type.

Alternatively, you may smash this bottle of oil on a hard

surface up to 20 feet away from you. If you do so, the oil
violently reacts and creates a blinding flash of light,
affecting any creature in a 10-foot radius of it. Any creature
in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw.

forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own
save. If the spell was an attack, the attack roll is rerolled
against the chosen creature.

Silhouette Shawl
Wondrous item, common
Crafted by: Shadow Mastiff Fur x1 small bag (Artificer)
While wearing this shawl, you may spend your action to

stone giant. This anvil is magically enchanted so that
sufficiently heated stones that have been placed on it act
like heated metal. The stone is able to be shaped in much
the same way as heated metal can, and then resumes its
original stone properties once removed from the anvil.

Stone Swim Armor
Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Korred Hide x1 (Blacksmith)
While wearing and attuned to this armor, you gain the
following abilities:

You have a tremorsense out to 60 ft.
You have a burrow speed equal to your walking speed.
You may burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth
and stone. You do not disturb the material you move
through.
You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made
to hide in rocky terrain.

Sun Stream Bow
Weapon (longbow or shortbow), very rare (requires
attunement)
Crafted by: Ki-Rin Fur x7 bolts (Blacksmith)
This bow does not require any physical arrows to be loaded
in order to make an attack; instead, whenever its string is
drawn back, a Sun Arrow made of solid light is formed in
the wielder’s pull hand which dissipates after either 6
seconds, or when it hits a solid object, whichever comes
first.

Sun Arrows deal an additional 1d6 radiant damage upon
a successful hit and leave a trail of sunlight behind them as
they fly through the air. This trail of sunlight illuminates
everything in a 5-foot radius around it in bright light and
dissipates at the start of the wielder’s next turn. This
sunlight created by these arrows is considered equivalent
to a 3rd level spell for the purposes of overcoming magical
darkness.

Stunning Lens
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Gauth Main Eye x1 (Artificer)
While wearing this item, as an action, you may target a
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If it can see you,
that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving
throw or become stunned until the start of its next turn.
Once this ability has been used once, it can’t be used again
until the next dawn.

Swarm Charms
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Swarm Mentality x1 (Artificer)
This set of 4 paper charms on silver chains share an innate
connection with each other that allows their wearers to act
as if they were one entity. Any willing creature wearing a
charm from this set becomes a member of the swarm.
Members of the swarm that are on the same plane of
existence may communicate with each other telepathically,
including the sending of memories and images. In addition,
the Intelligence scores of all members of the swarm
become equal to that of the member with the highest
Intelligence score within 30 feet of them. If a member
removes their charm or moves farther than 30 feet away,
their Intelligence score returns to normal.

This shared connection comes at a price, however. If a
member of the swarm becomes subjected to an effect that
would impose a Wisdom or Intelligence saving throw, all
members of the swarm become targeted by the same
effect, even if they would not otherwise be a valid target.

Yeenoghu’s Boon
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Shoosuva Heart x1 (Thaumaturge)
If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack
on your turn while wearing this charm, you may take a
bonus action to move up to half your speed and then make
another basic melee weapon attack. Once this ability has
been used once, it cannot be used again until you have
taken a short rest.

Yeenoghu’s Wrath
Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Shoosuva Tail x1 (Leatherworker)
You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this
weapon. As a bonus action, you may cause the stinger on
the end of this whip to exude a noxious poison. The next
creature you successfully hit with this weapon must
succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become
poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the target is also
paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. Once used this ability cannot be used again until
you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon
attack.

Telepathic Lens
Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Mindwitness Main Eye x1 (Tinker)
This bizarre contraption has a hollowed out mindwitness
eye secured by brass wires to a magically imbued lens
about the size of a human’s head. While looking through
this lens, you may telepathically communicate
simultaneously to as many creatures as you can see within
120 feet of you.

Tormentor’s Cap
Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Meenlock Head x1 (Artificer)
While wearing this cap, you may spend an action to target a
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If you do so, that
creature must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, you learn that creature’s greatest fear, and for
the next 24 hours, you have advantage on Charisma
(Intimidation) checks made against them. In addition, if
they were incapacitated, they also take 3d6 psychic
damage. On a successful save, that creature becomes
immune to the effects of this item and is made aware of you
targeting them. This item has no effect on creatures that
are immune to the fear condition.

Wand of the Golden Ray
Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
Crafted by: Ki-Rin Horn x1 (Artificer)
While holding this wand, you gain a +2 bonus to spell
attack rolls. In addition, when you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage
dice for a spell that deals radiant damage, you can reroll
the die and you must use the new roll.

Whip of Extended Reach
Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Morkoth Tentacles x2 (Leatherworker)
You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this
weapon. When you hit a Medium or smaller sized creature
with this weapon, you may make a grapple check against
them as a free action, using the whip to grapple instead of
your free hand. This ability can only be used once per turn.
While you have a creature grappled in this way, you may
not attack with this whip.

In addition, while holding this 10-foot long weapon, you

may spend your action to focus on it and force it to adopt
any position or shape you wish, as if it were an extension of
your own body. You may spend any subsequent actions to
maintain your focus on the whip and either keep it in the
same position or move it into a new one. While focusing on
the whip, you also are able to feel sensations of touch
through the whip. If you attempt to make an attack with the
whip, or do not spend an action focusing on it, it falls limp
and you no longer are able to feel through the whip.

Withering Lenses
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Catoblepas Eye x2 (Artificer)
While wearing these lenses, you may target a creature you
can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC
16 Constitution saving throw, suffering 8d8 necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half that on a success. If the
saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target instead takes 64
necrotic damage. The target dies if reduced to 0 hit points
by this ability.

Once used, this ability may not be used again until the

next dawn.

Chapter 5: Miscellaneous Additions

Harvesting is a holistic art. It is not simply

the physical act of cutting and slicing
through a carcass, it is the tools you use,
the rules you live by and the skills you have;
in short it is an entire lifestyle! Once you
have assumed the life of a harvester, you
will see the world in a different way, and

find the new possibilities and options open to you.
However, in the case that you haven’t, I’ve listed them down
here for you anyway.” - Hamund

This guide introduces a few new concepts into the base
game of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, and as part of
that, a few slight alterations and/or additions need to be
made to existing concepts and features in the game to
accommodate them. While some of these changes are not
strictly necessary for this guide to be used, they are advised
in order to get the maximum value out of this book.

Special Tools

A few new pieces of adventuring gear have been added in
this book to accommodate the act of harvesting. Their
functions are described below:

Enchanted Vial
Some creature parts have powerful, yet fleeting, magical
energies within them. The motes from elementals for
example hold traces of their former essences in them but
disperse rapidly upon the destruction of their original form.
An enchanted vial is inlaid with several runes designed
to keep any magical resource within from dissipating while
the lid is closed and is often the only way of transporting
certain parts back to a workshop for crafting.

Items that require an enchanted vial to be harvested are

fragile by nature and must be stored inside an enchanted
vial quickly to prevent degradation. Any attempt to
harvest a material that has an enchanted vial as a
requirement must be initiated within 1 minute of the
death of its creature.

Hamund’s Harvesting Handbook
“Yes, you can own a copy of this very book in any plane you
visit! Due to my travels, I have visited almost every world in
the multiverse, dropping manuscripts in publishers’ hands
as I go. No matter where you are, or where you come from,
this handy book is sure to help you get the most out of
whatever your local fauna has to offer.” - Hamund

This book is filled with all sorts of useful information on
the creatures that inhabit the multiverse, specifically, which
parts of them are useful for harvesting. Using this book
grants you advantage on any Appraise ability check.

Harvesting Kit
This kit contains everything the average harvester needs to
prepare and harvest a carcass for usable parts including a
skinning knife, a bonesaw, 2 glass vials, pouches of salt,
and tweezers. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your
proficiency to any check made to harvest a creature.

Spirit Paper
Spirit paper is a versatile tool that resembles a square of
bleached papyrus. The secrets of its production were only
recently discovered, and reverse engineered from secrets
brought back from distant necromantic cults. By
performing a small ritual with the spirit paper shortly after
slaying certain creatures, a copy of that creature’s soul is
bound to the spirit paper for later use. These copies are not
a true soul and are more akin to an echo. These echoes do
retain all of the memories from its original body, and a few
crafting techniques utilise these echoes to grant an item a
low level of sentience or to mimic the abilities of their
incorporeal reflections.

Using spirit paper is often the only way to harvest

anything useful from creatures with incorporeal forms. Any
harvesting attempt made for a creature part that has spirit
paper as a requirement is done using a Wisdom (Religion)
check rather than the usual check and is rolled separately
for each item. Once a sheet of spirit paper has been used
successfully to harvest an item, it cannot be reused, even if
the item it contained is released.

Unlike most harvestable materials, materials that require

spirit paper to be harvested dissipate very quickly after the
death of its creature. Any attempt to harvest a material that
has spirit paper as a requirement must be initiated within 1
minute of the death of the creature and takes 10
minutes to successfully complete.

Additions and Changes

The following are a few balance changes to accomodate the
harvesting and crafting rules in this guide, as well as a
background and feat to incorporate harvesting into your
game.

New Proficiency: Harvesting Kit
This guide adds in the new tool: the harvesting kit. Players
may have proficiency in this like any other tool, and it is
highly advised for them to have it as it provides a valuable
bonus when making the checks outlined in this book. In
order to accommodate this additional tool, the following
classes and backgrounds have been slightly altered to give
them the option to gain proficiency in the Harvesting Kit.

Rangers may have proficiency with the harvesting kit
upon character creation (this skill is not gained in
multiclassing)
Druids may have the option to choose between
proficiency in the herbalism kit or the harvesting kit
upon character creation (this skill is not gained in
multiclassing)

New Spells

"Having preferred the hands-on approach, I never had
much of an affinity for magic myself. However, one must
always endeavour to expand one's horizons, so I have
scoured the planes looking for spells to bolster my (already
impressive) skills. The result is the following spells,
curated from the minds of the greatest witch-doctors,
soothsayers, and magic-men that I have encountered on my
travels." - Hamund

A few new spells have been added to the game. Each one
either aids with harvesting, or has harvesting as a core
mechanic. In many cases, the spells have uses in both
combat and in harvesting, making them especially
versatile. Feel free to add any of them to your own game to
support your players' harvesting fantasies.

Cold Storage
4th-level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (A small 3-inch by 3-inch wooden
box lined with cork)
Duration: Concentration, duration varies

You attempt to send one creature that you can see within
range to a freezing cold pocket dimension. If you cast this
spell on a living creature, the duration of this spell is 1
minute, and the target must succeed on a Charisma saving
throw or be banished to your pocket dimension. While
there, the target is incapacitated and suffers 2d6 cold
damage at the start of each of its turns and may make a
Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If
they succeed, the spell ends, and they reappear in the
nearest unoccupied space to you.

If you target a dead creature with this spell, this duration

of this spell is indefinite. The creature’s body experiences
no decomposition while it is in your pocket dimension and
the cold damage does not affect the condition of the body.
When the spell ends, the creature’s body reappears in the
nearest unoccupied space to you and then warms back up
to the temperature it had before it was banished.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell

slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional
creature for each slot level above 4th.

Conjure Creature
5th-level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (the intact heart of the creature you
wish to conjure, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instant
Target a space within range while holding the heart of the
creature you wish to conjure. When you cast this spell, the
creature’s heart disintegrates into dust, and a copy of that
creature appears in the space you targeted. If there is not
enough room to accommodate that creature, the spell
automatically fails.

The conjured creature immediately performs one action
of your choice from its statblock and gets to move up to its
speed, and then disintegrates into dust. If the creature was
a spellcaster, it has access to all of the spells it had in life,
however any lingering magical effects that resulted from
that creature’s action disappear when the creature does. A
conjured creature has replicas of any non-magical
equipment it had when it died and may use them as if they
were the originals.

A creature’s heart may be harvested with a DC 10

harvesting check unless otherwise stated in its harvesting
table.

Hamund’s Harvesting Hands
1st-level conjuration (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 10 feet
Components: S, M (a sharp knife and a pair of gloves)
Duration: Varies
Target a dead creature within range that has a CR of 3 or
less. This spell conjures an invisible pair of hands that
harvest that creature for any useful materials as listed in
their harvesting table. No ability check is required to
harvest these materials, the hands automatically succeed
in harvesting them, and then place them next to the
creature’s carcass. You still need to provide any requisite
containers such as vials or bags, but the hands harvest all
materials in half the time it would normally take. You may
direct the hands to harvest certain materials first. Once all
of a creature’s useful materials have been harvested, the
hands disappear.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell

slot of 2nd level or higher, the CR of the creature
harvestable increases by 3 for each slot level above 1st.

Identify Vitals
1st-level enchantment (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (a small crystal lens set in a gold frame
worth at least 50 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Target a creature within range that you can see. You gain
knowledge of any damage vulnerabilities they may have,
and for the duration of the spell, your vision is augmented
to allow you to see that creature’s internal anatomy,
allowing you to strike with greater precision and
deadliness. Before the spell ends, you have advantage on
attack rolls against that creature, and you can also score a
critical hit on that creature with a roll of 19 or 20.

If you target a dead creature with this spell, you also gain

the benefits of a successful Appraisal check on that
creature. The benefit of this Appraisal check is not lost
after the duration of this spell.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell

slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional
creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must
be within 60 feet of each other when you target them.

Recomposition
3rd-level necromancy (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (A silver needle and thread, and a
stick of incense)
Duration: Instant
At the end of the casting time of this spell, you touch a dead
creature. That creature’s corpse undergoes a process of
reverse decomposition, restoring it to pristine condition,
and any injuries it may have had at the time of its death are
repaired. This spell however cannot restore missing body
parts unless those body parts are held to the corpse at the
time of casting this spell, nor does this reset the time
limitations that other spells have in raising the dead.

If this spell has been cast on a dead creature that has

been subjected to a failed Harvesting check, any
unharvested materials become available again and may be
subjected to another Harvesting check. A dead creature
may only be subjected to this spell once; any subsequent
attempts automatically fail.

Transfusion
2nd-level necromancy

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach
that has blood in its body. On a hit, the creature takes 2d4
necrotic damage and you drain a number of vials of blood
equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt, which you
may automatically store into an empty vial in your
possession. If the number of vials of blood you drained
equals or exceeds the target’s drain threshold (based on
size as shown in the table below), the target must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start
of your next turn.

Large

Gargantuan

Drain Threshold

This spell does not change the number of vials of blood

you can harvest from that creature’s carcass.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell

slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4
each slot level above 2nd.

Fixer
Name: Alanna Domine
Race: Human
Hamund’s Notes: Alanna has always intimately known the
power of words. Born into poverty and growing up amongst
pickpockets, Alanna relied more on the speed of her wit
than on the speed of her fingers to survive. A rumour here,
the right piece of information there, and an intercepted
letter or two; these were the blocks upon which Alanna
built a fixing and information brokering empire.

Today, Alanna describes her job as being very simple: she
gets the right people to talk to each other. In exchange for a
small fee, she will get prospective clients in contact with
mercenaries willing to do whatever job necessary. For us
harvesters, this means a steady supply of work; harvesting
rare materials for anyone with the coin to pay for it. If you
are looking to pick up a little extra spending money, just
start asking around for Alanna. She’s sure to pop out of the
shadows soon enough, with a laundry list of materials for
you to find, and all at a premium rate.

Hamund's Helpers

"Despite the rugged independent asthetic that I exude, I
must assure you that harvesting is not a solitary profession!
What we do as harvesters is simply the first step in a long
chain of commerce and industry, without which, our work
would be meaningless. In my career, I have established a
long list of faithful contacts and friends that I refer to as my
"Helpers." Without them, I would merely be a random man
slicing animals open in the wilderness! I pass their
information on to you, my dear readers, with my
reassurance that their services are second to none. All I
ask is that if you find them and engage their services, let
them know that Hamund sent you." - Hamund

The following are a list of NPC crafters that a DM can
easily slot into any campaign or setting. Feel free to use
these NPC’s as convenient ways for the party to craft their
harvested materials into useful items, vendors to buy spare
materials, or even quest givers for certain monster parts.

Craftables Vendor
Name: Whisper
Race: ???
Hamund’s Notes: I have known Whisper for some time
now, however I still know very little about her; mostly due
to her living up to her name and being almost impossible to
hold a proper conversation with. I still do not know what
race she is, where she is travelling, or if that is even her
true face or simply a mask.

What I do know is that she carries on her back an

amazing assortment of magical items, all of them crafted
from creatures, and all of them for sale. Where she got all
of these items is yet another mystery, as is the fact that her
inventory always seems to have the exact item that you are
looking for. Now, as enticing as all that would be, I must
highly advise those of you with sticky fingers to behave
yourselves around her. After all, if those powerful magical
items are the ones she’s willing to get rid of, what kind of
power do you think she keeps for herself?

Master Crafter
Name: Orryn Folkor
Race: Gnome
Hamund’s Notes: I have known Orryn since we were
children, and I regard him as both one of my closest friends
and one of the sharpest minds in existence. I recall Orryn
being a particularly sensitive boy, often relying on me to
fend off bullies and tormentors for him. Still, he was
exceptionally bright, taking a keen interest in all sorts of
magic and research. As I honed my harvesting skills, he
would hone his crafting skills. He would create something
wondrous out of the materials I gave him, and it is thanks
to him that I am even aware of half the craftables included
in this book. No trade is beyond his talents as a polymath,
and he is seemingly able to work with anything you give
him.

Today, Orryn wanders much like I do, seeking out new
materials to whet his interests and creativity. If you find
him, simply mention my name and he is sure to help you
with whatever item you wish to craft.

Trapper
Name: Rangrim Holderhek
Race: Dwarf
Hamund’s Notes: Yet another of the Holderhek clan
included in my book, this time my nephew: Rangrim. The
lad has never been an easy one to work with; having always
had a temper fierier than his hair. After countless
disagreements and fights with the clan elders, the last
straw came when he was forced to choose between the
bear cub he found or his place in the clan. For Rangrim, the
choice was easy.

He now roams the wilds as a hunter and harvester
himself, always followed by his precious bear partner:
Lodinn. While he is not quite on the same level of
harvesting skill as his dear old uncle, his brash
stubbornness seems to have granted him a better head for
business. If you spot him in the open or in town, feel free to
approach him and barter for harvesting materials. Rangrim
never seems to run out of space in his many bags and
pouches, and you will find him to be an honest vendor to
offer you coin for your excess stock. Be warned though to
never cheat him, or you will find out just how well trained
Lodinn really is.

Supplier
Name: Sellek (Translation: Hunter)
Race: Lizardfolk
Hamund’s Notes: Honestly, I am still a little wary around
Sellek. It is rare to find a lizardfolk outside of their swamp
villages, and even rarer to find one such as Sellek who
seems so comfortable, and perhaps even happy, to live
among warm blooded humanoids. I can only conclude that
Sellek is at least partially crazy, which is saying a lot when
it comes to lizardfolk.

Despite that, Sellek is one of the finest hunters I have

ever seen, bolstered by the high-quality tools that he
designed and made himself. Harvesters come from all
around, seeking to buy his superior quality traps, bags, and
equipment. If there is anything you need for your
harvesting adventures, be sure to seek Sellek out for the
finest selection of equipment.

Just try to avoid eye contact with him when you do.

Chapter 6: Hamund's Have-Nots

Suggested Locations
The environment that the Target is often found in. Use this
to help determine if a quest is appropriate, given your
party's current location. The possible environments are as
follows:

Arctic
Cave
Coast
Desert
Forest
General
Grassland
Mountain
Swamp
Urban

"General" denotes that the creature can appear in any
environment.

Description
A brief explanation of the requirements of the quest, and
the motivation of the quest giver in asking for the material.
While the "Description" of the quest is designed to be read
verbatim by a present NPC, they may also be included as
written notices on a job board, or simply used as
inspiration for the Dungeon Master to interpret to fit their
own campaigns.

Occasionally, the motivation for retrieving a material may
be at odds with the personality of the party. In these cases,
the Dungeon Master may feel free to either change the
motivation, or to incorporate it into their actual campaign.
As always, information in this book is intended to be used
to support the playstyle of the individual table, and groups
are encouraged to adapt it to their own games.

Reward
The bounty given to the players for successfully retrieving
the requested material. This amount is usually 1.5x the
normal price of the material. The price is given per request
delivered. For example, Ander Greenbottle asks for "Blight
Seeds x5" and the reward is listed as "1 gold piece." This
mean that he will pay 1 gold piece for all 5 Blight Seeds,
not one 1 gold piece per Blight Seed.

However, many quests offer the option for the players to

submit the request more than once. This is not explicitly
stated, but it is implied in the description of the quest. In
such cases, the players may receive the same reward each
time they hand in the requested material.

Ihave been an adventurer for as long as I have been

a harvester. As part of that, I have met a myriad of
people from all over the multiverse, many of whom
have asked for my help and expertise on whatever
problems may plague them. Unfortunately, I am
but one person, and do not have the resources to
help everyone. Instead, I have done the next best

thing: write down their details to outsource these quests to
my readers! If you are in the altruistic mood (or just in the
need for some extra coin), consider lending someone in
here a hand." - Hamund

The following is a list of quests featuring every single
monster from the Monster Manual and Volo's Guide to
Monsters. The aim is to provide a quick quest or incentive
for Dungeon Masters to throw to their players, or to give an
extra incentive to hunt down a particular monster.

Understanding the Board

The following is a basic rundown of how to read and use
the quest board. The quest board is designed to be used on
the fly by Dungeon Masters, and groups are encouraged to
adapt these to their own tables.

CR
All quests are separated out by Challenge Rating in
ascending order and the in alphabetical order based on the
Target. Dungeon Masters are encouraged to look up a
Challenge Rating appropriate for their party and then to
pick a target appropriate for their current environment.

Target
This lists the creature to be hunted in the quest, listed in
alphabetical order.

Request
This is the harvesting material being asked for by the quest
giver. More often than not, a material with no explicit
mechanical use has been chosen for the request. This is so
that players do not have to choose between completing a
quest, and keeping the material for themselves to use.
Many quests also allow the players to supply the

requested material more than once, getting an additional
bounty each time.

Requester Name
The name of the quest giver. Feel free to change the names
to suit your own game. Also note that some quest givers
appear more than once, often asking for similar items or to
achieve similar goals. Dungeon Masters are encouraged to
use these as NPCs in their own game or adapt them as
they need.

Race
The race of the quest giver. Most races chosen are from the
Player's Handbook, and especially from the "main" races of
Human, Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling. This was in order to make
them as adaptable to individual tables as possible. That
said, some esoteric races also appear such as Tiefling,
Goliath, Tabaxi, etc. If any of these contradict your own
games, you are encouraged to adapt them to your own
table. All included races appear in either the Player's
Handbook or in Volo's Guide to Monsters.

Target: Cockatrice
Request: Cockatrice Beak
Requester Name: Kathra Stoneslope
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland
Description: “Stonework animals have seen a surge in
popularity these days, problem is, they take a damn long
time to carve. I want to speed up the process a little with a
cockatrice beak. Just take a petrifying dagger to some
critters and sell the results. I’m just going to need the beak
first.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Cranium Rat
Request: Cranium Rat Brain
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave, Urban
Description: “Of all the illithid experiments out there, the
brain of a cranium rat is among the ones I am most excited
to study. Most of my samples of illithid experiments come
from humanoids like grimlocks and duergar, so you can
imagine how interesting it is to see illithid influence on the
simple brain of a beast. The way their feral instincts
interacts with psionic control is fascinating, and I simply
cannot have enough samples. If you can bring them back in
one piece, I will gladly pay you for each brain you can find.”
*Reward:3 gp

Target: Crawling Claw
Request: Cursed Knucklebones
Requester Name: Shragga Greenfist
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “There’s a piece of drek in my mercenary
band with a real chip on her shoulder. Seems to think she’s
the best fighter to ever walk the Multiverse. I want to take
her down a peg or two, and I was thinking making her lose
all her money next time she goes gambling would be good.
I’ve heard that a set of dice crafted from a hand touched by
necromancy can help me out in that regard.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Darkling
Request: Darkling Ash (small pouch)
Requester Name: Umbero Falone
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I am always on the lookout to make my
employees more effective in their…night-time activities. One
thing that would help is a better way of blacking out torches
and lamps. I’ve heard that darkling ash is particularly
useful for this purpose, and I would pay a decent price for
anyone that can get me some…discreetly.”
Reward: 3 gp

CR <1
Target: Aarakocra
Request: Aarakocra Feathers x1 small pouch
Requester Name: Soft-Treading Paw (Tread) of the Long
Cliff clan
Race: Tabaxi
Suggested Locations: Desert, Mountain
Description: “Many times have I bragged to my friend
about managing to hunt the largest birds in these known
lands. However, he’s finally decided to call my bluff and ask
for proof; I need to show him something. I have heard of
race of bird people known as Aarokocra whose feathers
should be big enough to convince him of my prowess. All I
need is a few to shove in his face so that I can save mine."
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Blight (any)
Request: Blight Seed x5
Requester Name: Ander Greenbottle
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland, Swamp
Description: “I got a need to grow some crops real fast,
and the only way I can think of doing that is if I have a little
magic fertiliser. A druid friend told me that crushing up
some blight seeds and mixing it in with the soil would do
the trick, so I’ll take any you can find. I just hope it don’t
change the taste of my pumpkins too bad.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Boggle
Request: Slippery Boggle Oil (vial)
Requester Name: Quarion Candlebrook
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Forest, Swamp, Urban
Description: “This prank never gets old. Pour some oil
outside someone’s room and watch them slip and slide as
they try to make their way down the hall. While any oil will
do, I am impartial to the oil of a boggle myself. It tends to
have a consistency that allows for the furthest slides (and of
course, the greatest hilarity).”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Bullywug
Request: Bullywug Tongue
Requester Name: Lavinia Brushgather
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Swamp
Description: “There’s been too many dangnab bullywugs
hopping around my hut recently. They’re a cowardly bunch,
so I bet if I put up a few warnings, they ought to back off. I’d
say that nailing the tongues of a couple of their kin to my
door oughta do the trick.”
Reward: 2 sp

Target: Chitine
Request: Chitine Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Riskel Firestrider
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “It must have taken the drow significant effort
to make a race that is even uglier and more hate-filled than
themselves, and yet, they somehow achieved that with the
chitine. The blood of these mutants also carry the enzymes
necessary for brewing drow poison, which I want to use on
the drow themselves."

Request: Darkmantle Otolith
Requester Name: Darvin Evenwood
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I was born deaf, but honestly, I’ve never had
a problem with it or wanted to change it. Thing is though,
there’s a bard that’s rolled into town recently and I’ve grown
a bit enamoured with them. I’d like a chance to listen to
their music, and the only way I can see that happening is if
I get some magical assistance. I’ve been told that a magic
hearing horn can be crafted from the otolith of a
darkmantle, if someone would just be kind enough to get
me one.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Dimetrodon
Request: Dimetrodon Hide

Target: Drow
Request: Drow Blood
Requester Name: Riskel Firestrider
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “At long last we’ve discovered the secret to
the drow’s deadly poison: their own blood. It must be a sign
from providence for us, to be able to kill drow and then use
their own blood against them as a weapon. Bring me their
blood and I will happily pay a handsome bounty.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Dryad
Request: Dryad Hair
Requester Name: Grigor Dotsk
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Forest

can to have a reminder of that fair creature I saw.”

Request: Duergar Brainstem
Requester Name: Travok Darksbane
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “The duergar are a disgrace to the dwarven
identity, and it is my mission to eradicate them wherever

however; I will pay a bounty to anyone that can bring me
proof of a duergar’s demise.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Faerie Dragon
Request: Faerie Dragon
Requester Name: Anders Dagon
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland
Description: “I’m running out of time to complete my
studies and I need anything I can get my hands on to speed
it up. I’ve done some research and found that faerie dragon
blood boasts special properties that makes it particularly
conducive to the inscription of magical runes and texts. If
it’s true, it may just be the thing I need to finish my
spellbook before my master flunks me out of my
apprenticeship.”
Reward: 6 gp

Target: Firenewt Warrior
Request: Firenewt Mucus (vial)
Requester Name: Jarrod Gerkirk
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Mountain
Description: “I’ve had a lot of orders lately and
unfortunately haven’t had a chance to restock my supplies.
In particular, I’m running low on lubricants; without which
my operations will come to a literal grinding halt. There’s a
lot of different lubricants I could get, but firenewt mucus
serves me particularly well for its insulation properties.”

Request: Flumph Spray
Requester Name: Quarion Candlebrook
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I’m in a bit of a spat these days with one of
my neighbours and have figured out the best way to get a
little harmless revenge on him. I’m going to bake him some
goodies with a nasty surprise in the center: flumph spray.
Imagine his disgust when he bites into a scrumptious
cookie only for his mouth to be filled with the most horrid
concoction, oh it’ll be hilarious!”

Target: Flying Sword
Request: Animating Rune x3
Requester Name: Ella Ningel
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’m working on a commission piece: a
diorama of the Battle of Four Flags. I thought I might go
that extra mile in having the soldiers actually move by
imbuing them with a little bit of magic, but I’ve run low on
the materials to do so. I can’t get enough of them, so any
that you got I’ll take.”

Target: Gas Spore

Requester Name: Cloud on the Mountaintop from the
Snoring Mountain clan
Race: Tabaxi
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest
Description: “When I was a child, I saw a travelling
merchant with the most wondrous items and trinkets. One
of them was a stuffed animal that floated around without
any magic. I was mystified by it back then, and even to this
day I think about the joy I had chasing it around. These
days, I believe he was just using the spores from a gas
spore fungus to make it float, but I would still like some of
it for myself, if at the very least to entertain my own
children.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Gazer
Request: Gazer Main Eye
Requester Name: Yuldra Stayanoga
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Urban
Description: “It’s odd. Despite having accomplished many
things during my magical career, I have never gotten
around to summoning up a familiar; it’s the independent
fire in me I suppose. Anyway, I feel that because I’m getting
older now, perhaps I should try my hand at it. I don’t want
any ordinary one though, I want something more unique
and interesting. A gazer would be nice; if you manage to
find one and pluck out its main eye, bring it to me, would
you?”
Reward: 6 gp

Target: Ghoul
Request: Ghoul Hide
Requester Name: Alsten Turen
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Let’s be honest, of all the dangerous issues
in the world, the undead are probably the most pressing.
That is why I try to study them whenever I can, to learn
them and their weaknesses, and hopefully, a way to defeat
them. To that end, I need study samples; a ghoul’s hide
should be a good start.”
Reward: 60 gp

Target: Gnoll
Request: Gnoll Tooth (small pouch)
Requester Name: Evendur Dundragon
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “This is pretty simple. We got too many gnolls

Request: Gray Residue (vial)
Requester Name: Bruenor Toilhands
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “Here’s what my dear ‘pa used to say: ‘you
don’t need to work a shovel if you know how to pour a vial.’
That’s because his tool of choice was concentrated acid to
eat through layers of stone and dirt like they were made of
sugar. The best source of it comes from oozes: they’re
plentiful, potent, and if you leave it long enough it starts to
reproduce itself. That said, I’ll take any samples you have,
I’ve always got more projects than I have materials for.”
Reward: 10 gp

Target: Grimlock
Request: Grimlock Brain
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “Grimlocks are an interesting bunch.
Generations of being subjected to the machinations of the
illithid’s experiments have made them simultaneously
incredibly stupid yet gifted with decent mental powers. I
want samples of their brains for study; perhaps I can
unlock their mental talents without the off-putting side
effects.”

Request: Grung Poison Gland
Requester Name: Fargrim Stonebrew
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Swamp
Description: “There’s nothing better in life than a good
drink, but after years of the same ales, beers, and whiskeys,
I’m itching to try something new. I’ve heard that swampfolk
brew up a mighty strong drink using the poison glands of
the grung; something so strong it’ll make you see things. If
you could go out and collect some for me, I’m sure the
swampfolk would thank you too for ridding them of their
pesky neighbours.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Homunculus
Request: Homunculus Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Anders Dagon
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Okay, I think I know how to pass my finals
exam. Despite my academic record, I am actually an
extraordinarily fast writer. Thus, I’m pretty sure that if I
drink a vial of homunculus blood, I can finish my exam
before it wears off and before I get the strong withdrawal
symptoms. All I need is the homunculus from a good
wizard and I’m good to go.”

got our name. It’s been years since I’ve been able to get a

about anything to get some sleep, even if it means using a
jackalwere’s eyes to cast some super strong sleep magic on
myself.”

Target: Kenku
Request: Kenku Voice Box
Requester Name: Jarrod Gerkirk
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Urban
Description: “I have a couple of orders for music boxes
that I do not have the resources to fulfil at the moment. I’ve
also heard that there’s a bunch of kenku thieves causing a

boxes that I need to make these music boxes, I won’t ask
you where you got them.”

Target: Kuo-toa Whip
Request: Kuo-Toa Brain
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Coast
Description: “The kuo-toa are another fascinating result of
illithid experimentation. Their brains are so chaotic yet so

figure out how they work and add some method to their
madness.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Lemure
Request: Lemure Essence
Requester Name: Kallista Nolioski
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “As the currency of the Nine Hells, lemure

around us.”

Requester Name: Syrio Folone
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest, Swamp
Description: “I have had it up to HERE with the bickering
and fighting that goes on in the meeting chambers of our
city council. For weeks now, the elites of the city have been
sniping at each other; all of them too proud to give an inch
of power to another, even if it is for the good of the city!
Well no more, for I have come up with a solution. I have
heard that the rapport spores of a myconid are capable of
increasing empathy among those who breathe them in;
perhaps if I spike the meeting chamber with some of them,
it’ll let our leaders finally see eye to eye. If not, then at least
it’ll allow them to communicate in a less noisy manner.”
Reward: 1 gp

Reward: 1 gp

Target: Magmin
Request: Magma Shell
Requester Name: Finnan Hilltopple
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “When they asked me to become an
adventurer, they never said anything about how BAD the
food would be. Nothing but salted beef and stale crackers
for weeks on end! And every time I offer to cook up
something nice, my companions give me the same excuse
that it’s too risky to light a fire where enemies might spot it.
Well, I just heard of a wondrous frying pan that doesn’t
need any fire to be used, and all it takes is the shell of a
magmin. Please find one for me: my appetite is on the line!”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Manes
Request: Manes Vapour (vial)
Requester Name: Shava Siannodel
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I am running low on alchemy supplies,
which causes me to worry about the wellbeing of the town
that I tend to as healer. If I could get any medicinal
supplies, I would happily pay out of my own savings for
them. Manes vapour may be off-putting, but it actually has
many uses as an inoculation substance and is crucial for
the winter months.”
Reward: 7 gp

Target: Mephit
Request: Mote of Dual Nature
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’m just so busy these days, I can’t even keep
the basics well stocked. Now normally, my assistant would
be the one to just summon mephitis and harvest them for
their motes, but he…exploded recently (he didn’t measure
the fiend powder to ignition gel ratio properly, and well
ALL know what happens then). So, if you have some
elemental motes, I’ll be glad to buy them off you.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Merfolk
Request: Merfolk Scales (small pouch)
Requester Name: Garurt
Race: Lizardfolk
Suggested Locations: Coast

Garurt will pay mercenaries bounty if they help him find
the shinies.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Neogi Hatchling
Request: Neogi Amygdala
Requester Name: Birgit Conchobar
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Desert, Mountain
Description: “The thing that every new commander fails to
grasp is the importance of troop morale; how willing are
your soldiers to charge into what may very well be their
deaths? Morale can make or break a battle, make no
mistake about that. As such, I want to make neogi
amygdalas a standard inventory item in our supply
caravans; I’ve heard that chewing on that for a while calms
a person down and gives them the steely resolve of the
uncaring insectoids themselves.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Orc
Request: Orc Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Malark Buckman
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’ve made a huge mistake. I was at the tavern
last week with the lads, tipping back a few pints of ale. To
be honest, the night’s a little hazy, but apparently in the
middle of it all I had challenged the biggest grognard in
town to a duel. Now I’m not much of a fighting man myself,
so I will most definitely die in that duel without some
outside help. Unfortunately, I’m also a bit strapped for cash,
so the only thing I can think of that I can also afford is
some orc blood. One sip of that stuff can turn any man into
a raging fighting machine…at least for a little while.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Orc Nurtured One of Yurtrus
Request: Yurtus Ichor (vial)
Requester Name: Irina Desilav
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “There is a man that I must kill, a cleric of a
dark god. My problem is that whenever I slice him open, he
simply heals the damage and runs away. I have heard
however of a fiendish poison that is capable of preventing
such magical healing. If I had it, I could finally end my
target once and for all.”
Reward: 5 gp

Target: Piercer
Request: Piercer Musk (vial)
Requester Name: Lilli Tarkelby
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “Unbeknownst to many of my customers, the
foul-smelling piercer musk is actually a key component in
many of my best-selling perfumes. In fact, the perfumes sell
so well that I’ve run low on musk. If you have any, I’ll gladly
take if off your hands, and even pay a premium if you can
remain discreet about it.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Pixie
Request: Pixie Dust (small pouch)
Requester Name: Quarion Candlebrook
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Forest
Description: “I’ve come up with the most whimsical idea
for my next party favour: pixie dust! Imagine my guests
delight as they open up a pouch and are sprinkled with
concentrated magic in powder form, not knowing what
wonderful effect they will get. I can see the laughs from the
room as they fly around, turn invisible, or shapeshift into
animals. Of course, some of them will be restrained by
thorny vines or be afflicted by madness, but that’s all part of
the fun isn’t it?”
Reward: 5 gp

Request: Pseudodragon Venom (vial)
Requester Name: Gordan Darkbag
Race: Halfling

about anything to get some sleep, even if it means
tranquilising myself with some pseudodragon venom.”

Reward: 2 gp

Target: Rust Monster
Request: Rust Monster Dust (large bag)
Requester Name: Quarion Candlebrook
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I’ve thought of another great prank. I’m
going to pour some rust monster dust on my guests next
time they come in. I can imagine the roars of laughter as
their armour corrodes and rusts up. Trust me, it’ll be
hilarious.”
Reward: 5 gp

Target: Sahuagin
Request: Sahuagin Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Wolyn Pumanath
Race: Triton
Suggested Locations: Aquatic
Description: “Sahuagin raids have become particularly
nasty as of late, and we’re going to need to step up our
arsenal if we have a chance of beating them back. We have
ideas for new poisons or deterrents we could make to fend
them off, but we’ll need to test them first. If you can bring
back some sahuagin blood, we would be in your debt.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Satyr
Request: Satyr Hair (small pouch)
Requester Name: [Anonymous]
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Forest
Description: “I can’t let anyone know about this, but I’m
actually as bald as a plucked chicken. I’ve been covering it
up for years with a variety of wigs, toupees, and hats, but
this charade has grown tiresome. I want to do something
more proactive about it, and I heard that satyr hair can
make a potion for combatting baldness. Get me some, and
please don’t tell anyone about this.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Shadow
Request: Shadow Wisp
Requester Name: Quarion Candlebrook
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’ve heard that leaving a shadow wisp in
someone’s shadow will drain them of their strength. As
nefarious as that sounds, I think it would make for a great
prank! I want to leave one in my houseguest’s room
overnight and see what happens, maybe have them awake
up groggier than when they went to sleep? I’m sure they’ll
laugh about it afterwards when I tell them what happened.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Shrieker
Request: Shrieker Spore Colony (vial)
Requester Name: Birgit Conchobar
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest
Description: “My officers have finally taken me up on my
suggestion of incorporating shrieker spores into the
standard kit of our mages. Such a thing would make sure
they don’t have to waste any of their energies on securing
camps at the end of the day, but it also means we need to
increase our supply of the spores. We’ll take any that you
can gather, at a premium too since we need them fast.”
Reward: 8 gp

Target: Skeleton
Request: Bone Dust (small pouch)
Requester Name: Lawrence Ichelm
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Nothing like some good bone dust for doing
your necromancy; and boy do I do a lot of necromancy. So
much necromancy in fact that some people have the
audacity to accuse me of being a lich in disguise. I have to
vehemently deny that accusation and state that I merely
have a skin condition that makes it look like I have no
skin…or flesh.”
Reward: 1 sp

Target: Slaad Tadpole
Request: Slaad Slime (vial)
Requester Name: Rhogar of the Fenkenkabradon clan
Race: Dragonborn
Suggested Locations: Cave, Swamp
Description: “Although it is a relatively rare occurrence,
being infested with a slaad egg is a horrible affliction that I
would not wish on anyone. The problem is that some of our
warriors can engage in a fight with a slaad and not realise
they’ve been infected until it is far too late. To remedy this, I
want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do
this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely.
Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to
protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can
make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens
that kill eggs as soon as they’re implanted.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Sprite
Request: Sprite Dust (small pouch)
Requester Name: Romero Domine
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Forest
Description: “I feel there’s this gulf between my husband
and I lately. There’s just some barrier in communication I
can’t seem to broach; like he’s not telling me how he feels. I
want to understand him better so I was thinking I could
use some sprite dust next time so I could understand his
emotions and figure out what’s troubling him.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Stirge
Request: Stirge Needle
Requester Name: Shava Siannodel
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest
Description: “I serve as the healer of the local village and
my supplies have run quite low lately. I don’t even have the
basics like needles for administering tinctures. Stirge
needles are a good substitute, and I will gladly pay out of
my own pocket for some supplies.”

Target: Troglodyte
Request: Troglodyte Hide
Requester Name: Gardain Glanhig
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “Despite troglodytes being generally useless,
their hides are actually quite useful. My favourite use is to
grind them up for a special pigment for invisible ink. If
you’re going down into the caves and see some troglodytes,
skin a few of them for me, would you?”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Animated Armour
Request: Animating Rune x3
Requester Name: Ella Ningel
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’m working on a commission piece: a
diorama of the Battle of Four Flags. I thought I might go
that extra mile in having the soldiers actually move by
imbuing them with a little bit of magic, but I’ve run low on
the materials to do so. I can’t get enough of them, so any
that you got I’ll take.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Bugbear

Request: Salamander Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Orsik Holderhek
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Desert, Mountain
Description: “Salamander blood is a pretty staple material

orders lately that I’m starting to run out. I’d gladly buy any
that you have, and at a premium too due to the urgency.”

Request: Firenewt Mucus (vial)
Requester Name: Jarrod Gerkirk
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Mountain
Description: “I’ve had a lot of orders lately and
unfortunately haven’t had a chance to restock my supplies.
In particular, I’m running low on lubricants; without which
my operations will come to a literal grinding halt. There’s a
lot of different lubricants I could get, but firenewt mucus
serves particularly well for its insulation properties.”

Reward: 3 gp

Target: Violet Fungus
Request: Violet Fungus Stalk
Requester Name: Grumbar
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest
Description: “I will not beat around the bush. I want
someone dead, and I want it to be painful. Unfortunately, I
am not in the position to do it face to face the way it should
be done, so I will need to resort to other methods. The
poison made from a violet fungus stalk is a particularly
torturous method of death, and one that I think is suitable
for my quarry.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Winged Kobold
Request: Kobold Teeth (small pouch)
Requester Name: Kosj
Race: Lizardfolk

Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountains, Urban
Description: “There’s something that’s been missing from
my theatre troupe’s performances of ‘The Scuttling King’
and I think I know what it is: realistic sound effects. Sure,
we can try to imitate the sounds of vermin, but
unfortunately, none of us are particularly good at it.
Recently however, I’ve heard that the tongue of a xvart can
imitate those sounds perfectly. If I had some of those for
noisemakers, I know our troupe will have the spookiest
performance in the whole land.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Zombie
Request: Zombie Juice (vial)
Requester Name: Lawrence Ichelm
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I must acknowledge that there are those
who think I am a lich, merely because of my skin condition
that makes it seem I have no skin, and my muscle condition
that makes it look like I have no flesh. I assure you that I
am very much a normal human. That said, I would like you
to find some zombie juice for me. I swear it’s not for any
necromantic or lich-y behaviour, it’s for my…skin condition.
Yes, that will do.”

Request: Giant Strider Hide
Requester Name: Beloril Durthame
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Mountain
Description: “I’m not nearly as young as I used to be, and
the cold winters are starting to get to me. What I could
really use is a warmer coat, something that can stay warm
on even the most frigid of days. The hide of a giant strider
would be nice; those beasties radiate a toasty heat at all
times, even in death.”
Reward: 1 gp

Request: Harpy Vocal Cords
Requester Name: Errich Highstring
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland, Mountain
Description: “It is my dream to be the greatest bard that
has ever lived, and to do that, I will need an instrument

performance with that in my hands: the ladies will be all
over me.”

price.”

Requester Name: Fargrim Stonebrew
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Swamp
Description: “There’s nothing better in life than a good
drink, but after years of the same ales, beers, and whiskeys,
I’m itching to try something new. I’ve heard that swampfolk
brew up a mighty strong drink using the poison glands of
the grung; something so strong it’ll make you see things. If
you could go out and collect some for me, I’m sure the
swampfolk would thank you too for ridding them of their
pesky neighbours.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Half-Ogre
Request: Half-Ogre Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Sutha
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Although it is not the most ideal source, a
half-ogre’s blood can still make for a decent strength-

potions from giants, but this will do if my supplies of giant
fingernails ever runs low.”

Request: Imp Head
Requester Name: Kallista Nolioski
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Tiefling
Description: “I have been researching the local cults in my
area and have discovered that they have repurposed imp
heads as a type of censer to seek out other fiends. No
doubt, such a thing would be of huge benefit in my own
endeavours, and I would like a sample of it myself.”

figure out how they work and add some method to their
madness.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Maw Demon

Requester Name: Perrin Porridgepot
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “My entire life has been turned upside down.
The other day, I saw a friend of mine whip out a set of fake
teeth that chattered on their own. We all had a quick laugh
at first, but that turned to awe as the teeth began to actually
devour a sausage that he had placed in front of it. Not only
that, but he could taste it as well, and the food actually
ended up in his real stomach! Imagine how fast I could eat
with a set of those teeth! I could lay claim to half the dinner
spread by myself! I need to make those teeth for myself,
even if it does come with the risk of a fiendish curse.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Nilbog
Request: Mirth Touched Smile
Requester Name: Quarion Candlebrook
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I always strive to make sure that any
houseguests of mine leave with a smile on their faces.
Unfortunately, some of them can be quite the sourpusses
so I need to resort to magical help to turn that frown upside
down. I had a wand of smiles a while ago, but it’s broken
down with overuse. I know how to craft a new one, all I
need is some residual magic form a goblin that’s been
touched by a nilbog spirit.”

Reward: 15 gp

Target: Quickling
Request: Quickling Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Mican Swiftwhistle
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland
Description: “Being on quickling blood is one of the most
amazing experiences you’ll ever have, my friend. Imagine
being able to see the individual wing flaps of a
hummingbird, or a swift river flowing in slow motion. The
only issue is just how short its effects are! I’m always in the
market for some more blood to keep the feeling going, so if
you’re selling, I’m buying!”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Scarecrow
Request: Evil Spirit
Requester Name: Elias Silverbrook
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I despise the so-called ‘scarecrows’ made by
hags and lesser wizards. It’s such a waste of spiritual
energy to make such a weak servant. However, the only
reason the scarecrow is so weak is because these people
have no idea what they’re doing when it comes to construct
creation. I am going to prove to them you can make
something much more dangerous with the spirits they
have.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Sea Spawn
Request: Swan Spawn Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Birgit Conchobar
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Coast
Description: “As quartermaster, it’s my duty to make sure
that our armies have the supplies they need to stay healthy
and safe. One thing I’ve always pushed for is better
supplied ships, part of which is something to keep sailors
safe in the event of going overboard or capsizing. I want
potions of water breathing in every sailor’s kit, but to do
that, I’m going to need a lot of supplies. Thankfully, sea
spawn are pretty numerous, and their blood lends itself
well to the potion. I’ll buy any vials of their blood that you
bring me.”

Suggested Locations: Swamp
Description: “One of my basic services is to make a potion
for adventurers that will protect them from the various

many orders recently that I’m having trouble keeping up
with demand. While there are a lot of different bases that
can be used to craft the potion, one of the more common
ones is yuan-ti blood. If you get me some, I’ll gladly pay you
a decent price for it.”

Requester Name: Morthos
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Specters have a terrible existence, damned
to spend their undeath in a state of utter hatred and spite. I
want to help them, but first I need to study them. Specter
remnants or even poltergeist paper is all I need to start
working on some method to alleviate the spiritual pain that
they are in, and hopefully end this horrible curse forever.”
Reward: 6 gp/18 gp

Target: Thorny
Request: Thorny Thorns (small bag)
Requester Name: Ander Greenbottle
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest, Swamp
Description: “I got a need to grow some crops real fast,
and the only way I can think of doing that is if I have a little
magical fertiliser. A druid friend told me that crushing up
some thorny thorns and mixing it in with the soil should do
the trick, so I’ll take any you can find. I just hope it don’t
change the taste of my melons too bad.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Thri-Kreen
Request: Thri-Kreen Brain
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Desert
Description: “The thri-kreen are fascinating to me,
possessing psionic powers that rival the races influenced
by illithid experimentation. Their brains are so alien to the
rest of us that they are difficult to study, but I am
determined to figure out exactly how they work. I will need
a few more samples to study however.”
Reward: 8 gp

Request: Vargouille Jaw
Requester Name: Quarion Candlebrook
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “So I’ve heard of something called the ‘mirror
of insecurity’ and it was easily one of the most hilarious
things I’ve ever heard of. I can imagine using it right now
on some of my snootier house guests; listen to them shriek
as they think they’ve received some horrible curse, when in
reality, they’ve just been hit by a relatively benign curse. I
want to make this mirror immediately: I just need a
vargouille jaw to do it.”

Description: “I serve a little nearby town as healer, but I’m
running dangerously low on supplies. I’ll take anything you
can offer, and I’ll even pay for it out of my own pocket.

Requester Name: Milo Anymeal
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I’ve had a horrible case of indigestion for the
past few weeks. I can’t figure out what caused it, mostly
because the list of things I’ve eaten is too long to
remember. Regardless, I need something to get the system
running again, and a mixture of carrion crawler guts and
honey used to be my old ma’s recipe for that.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Centaur
Request: Centaur Tail
Requester Name: Fodel Chernin
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland
Description: “An archery contest is coming up and I need a
finer bow than the one I have now. I’ve heard that a bow
strung with a centaur tail’s hairs makes for a particularly
good one. Unfortunately it’s not like I can just ask them for
some tail hairs, so I’m going to need someone to go out and
get some for me.”

Request: Darkling Ash (small pouch)
Requester Name: Umbero Falone
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I am always on the lookout to make my
employees more effective in their…night-time activities. One

anyone that can get me some…discreetly.”

Target: Dragon Wyrmling
Request: Dragon Flesh
Requester Name: Wellby Tosscobble
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “As a gourmand, there is nothing more that I
enjoy than a sumptuous dragon steak. Some say the older
the dragon the better the flavour, but I’m impartial to the
wyrmlings myself. I find they’re more tender and amenable
to spicing.”

Target: Ettercap
Request: Web Gland
Requester Name: Hadarai Diamonddew
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Forest, Swamp
Description: “In the old days, we used to spin our ropes
from the webs of the ettercap. The younger generation

a stronger binding than hemp or mundane silk. I want to
teach these kids a lesson or two from the past, I just need
some materials to work with first.”

Requester Name: Merric Goodbarrel
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain, Urban
Description: “I work as a stonemason and it’s gotten a bit
tiresome trying to move these heavy blocks of stone
everywhere. I heard there was some artificers that can turn
gargoyle wings into a cloak that gives stone wings. If I get

whenever I have a job to do.”

Requester Name: Bruenor Toilhands
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “Here’s what my dear ‘pa used to say: ‘you
don’t need to work a shovel if you know how to pour a vial.’
That’s because his tool of choice was concentrated acid to
eat through layers of stone and dirt like they were made of
sugar. The best source of it comes from oozes, they’re
plentiful, potent, and if you leave it long enough it starts to
reproduce itself. That said, I’ll take any samples you have,
I’ve always got more projects than I have materials for.”
Reward: 10 gp

Request: Ghast Hide
Requester Name: Alsten Turen
Race: Gnome

Description: “Let’s be honest, of all the dangerous issues
in the world, the undead are probably the most pressing.
That is why I try to study them whenever I can, to learn
them and their weaknesses, and hopefully, a way to defeat
them. To that end, I need study samples; a ghoul’s hide
should be a good start.”

Request: Gibbering Mouther Teeth (small pouch)
Requester Name: Quarion Candlebrook
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I’ve figured out a great prank to use on my

Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General

Suggested Locations:
Description: “My wedding anniversary is coming up in a
few weeks and somehow, my wife has gotten it into her
head that I’m buying her a dragon-scale dress as a present.
I can tell you right now that I cannot afford that. However,

Request: Brain Fluid (vial)
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “As disgusting and dangerous as they are, the
intellect devourer is a triumph of transmutation and
alchemy. I am fascinated by their creation, but obviously,
details of their creation process are scarce. Their brain
fluids however contain traces of the devourer’s memories; if
I imbibe it, perhaps I can gain the memory of what it went
through and unlock its secrets that way.”

Description: “I used to live the life of an adventurer, but
those violent times are behind me. Now, I am simply a
farmer, tending to my herds. I abhor violence so much now
that I refuse to even strike my animals when they begin to
wander off. I have heard however, of elves that use
meenlock claws as a pacifistic way of calming over-excited
livestock. Something like that seems the perfect fit for my
preferred method of farming.”
Reward: 2 gp

Request: Merrow Scales
Requester Name: Garurt
Race: Lizardfolk
Suggested Locations: Coast
Description: “Ship merchants keep asking Garurt for new

Requester Name: Syrio Folone
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest, Swamp
Description: “I have had it up to HERE with the bickering
and fighting that goes on in the meeting chambers of our
city council. For weeks now, the elites of the city have been
sniping at each other; all of them too proud to give an inch
of power to another, even if it is for the good of the city!
Well no more, for I have come up with a solution. I have
heard that the rapport spores of a myconid are capable of
increasing empathy among those who breathe them in;
perhaps if I spike the meeting chamber with some of them,
it’ll let our leaders finally see eye to eye. If not, then at least
it’ll allow them to communicate in a less noisy manner.”

Requester Name: Anders Dagon
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Urban
Description: “Let’s get right to the point on this one: I am
going to fail my wizard apprenticeship if I don’t do
something FAST. My spellbook is sorely lacking in…well…
spells but I think I know the solution. An older student told
me that a nothic brain can yield some of its spells to a
wizard that writes in their book with its pulped remains.
Now, they may have just said it as some stupid hazing
prank, but at this point I’m willing to try anything.”

Request: Luthic-touched heart
Requester Name: Sillaron Orcsbane
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “As my name would suggest, I am descended
from a long line of orc hunters. It is a tradition in my family
to venture out into the world and destroy orcs wherever we
find them, taking their hearts back in triumph to our
ancestral home. I, however, have not done so well in this
regard. While I have cut through quite a few orcs, I have yet
to find any special ones: those touched by the orcish
pantheon. If I could bring a few of those home, even if they
were not from my kills, I would be able to return with no
small amount of glory.”
Reward: 8 gp

Request: Orc Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Malark Buckman
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’ve made a huge mistake. I was at the tavern
last week with the lads, tipping back a few pints of ale. To
be honest, the night’s a little hazy, but apparently in the
middle of it all I had challenged the biggest grognard in
town to a duel. Now I’m not much of a fighting man myself,
so I will most definitely die in that duel without some
outside help. Unfortunately, I’m also a bit strapped for cash,
so the only thing I can think of that I can also afford is
some orc blood. One sip of that stuff can turn any man into
a raging fighting machine…at least for a little while.”

Reward: 2 gp

Target: Pegasus
Request: Pegasus Hair
Requester Name: Erric Highstring
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland, Mountain
Description: “You should have seen my last performance; I
was bringing the roof down with how hard I was shredding
my lute. In fact, I shred so hard that my strings snapped. I
see this as something of a wake-up call: I need instruments
that can better match a bard of my calibre. To that end, I
want to restring my lute with pegasus hair; they say it gives
a flighty quality to your notes and songs.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Peryton
Request: Peryton Horn
Requester Name: Shragga Greenfist
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grasslands, Mountain
Description: ““There’s a piece of drek in my mercenary
band with a real chip on her shoulder. Seems to think she’s
the best fighter to ever walk the Multiverse. I want to take
her down a peg or two, and I was thinking making her lose
all her money next time she goes gambling would be good.
I’ve heard that a set of dice crafted from a peryton’s horns
are particularly unlucky. I’d be glad to shell out a few gold
pieces just to wipe that smile off her face.”
Reward: 5 gp

Target: Plesiosaurus
Request: Plesiosaurus Tooth
Requester Name: Vyth
Race: Lizardfolk
Suggested Locations: Coast, Forest
Description: “Vyth is a master of crafting with bone and
claw. Vyth has heard of large lizards and wants to make
weapons from them. Get these for him, and Vyth shall pay
you well.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Quaggoth
Request: Quaggoth Fur (small pouch)
Requester Name: Ilde Steelfur
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “I’ve learned my lesson from last time I went
spelunking; always bring some insulated clothes for those
cold Underdark depths. Quaggoth fur is particularly good
lining for coats and blankets, and it’s relatively comfortable
too. If you could get me some, you’d be making my life A
LOT more comfortable.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Rug of Smothering
Request: Animating Rune x3
Requester Name: Ella Ningel
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’m working on a commission piece: a
diorama of the Battle of Four Flags. I thought I might go
that extra mile in having the soldiers actually move by
imbuing them with a little bit of magic, but I’ve run low on
the materials to do so. I can’t get enough of them, so any
that you got I’ll take.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Wererat
Request: Lycanthrope Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Shevarra Dyenina
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Lycanthropy is a terrible affliction, and those
who are cursed by it should be cared for, not cast out. I run
a home that any lycan is free to come to and stay while they
turn their lives around. To help them, I brew up copious
amounts of moon muzzle mixture, but supply is always
limited since the blood required to make it must be
donated by an already deceased lycan. If you are ever
forced to kill one, please bring me their blood so that their
death may help save the life of another.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Will-o-wisp
Request: Mote of Necrotic Energy
Requester Name: Shava Sionnodel
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Forest, Swamp
Description: “I serve my local village as healer, which
unfortunately sometimes involves helping the critically ill
pass into death. I try to do it as painlessly as possible, and
I’ve found that the energy produced by will-o-wisps produce
the best results. Sprinkling their energy over a dying
person will kill them painlessly, instantly, and with no mark
left on their corpse. As macabre as it may sound, I would
like to stock up on these motes of necrotic energy for
those…less enjoyable moments of my job.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Yuan-ti Broodguard
Request: Yuan-ti Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Swamp
Description: “One of my basic services is to make a potion
for adventurers that will protect them from the various
poisons out there in the world. Unfortunately, I’ve gotten so
many orders recently that I’m having trouble keeping up
with demand. While there are a lot of different bases that
can be used to craft the potion, one of the more common
ones is yuan-ti blood. If you get me some, I’ll gladly pay you
a decent price for it.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Sahuagin Priestess
Request: Sahuagin Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Wolyn Pumanath
Race: Triton
Suggested Locations: Aquatic
Description: “Sahuagin raids have become particularly
nasty as of late, and we’re going to need to step up our
arsenal if we have a chance of beating them back. We have
ideas for new poisons or deterrents we could make to fend
them off, but we’ll need to test them first. If you can bring
back some sahuagin blood, we would be in your debt.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Sea Hag
Request: Hag Eyeball
Requester Name: Shanairra Liadon
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Forest, Swamp
Description: “The threat posed by hags has gone on for far
too long. I am studying a way to put an end to their vile race
once and for all, and I believe that the key lies in their
infamous eyes. With the way they are connected to them, I
believe they may be used as a method to find, hunt, and
destroy them easily. I will need more samples to
experiment with first though.”
Reward: 75 gp

Target: Shadow Mastiff
Request: Shadow Mastiff Drool (vial)
Requester Name: Fargrim Stonebrew
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “There’s nothing better in life than a good
drink, but after years of the same ales, beers, and whiskeys,
I’m itching to try something new. I’ve heard that dark dogs
called “shadow mastiffs” have a drool that you can make a
pretty interesting drink out of. Sure, the idea of drinking a
magical mutt’s spit isn’t the most tantalising, but that’s the
whole point of trying new things isn’t it?”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Spined Devil
Request: Spined Devil Spine
Requester Name: Smoking Mirror of the Rumbling River
clan
Race: Tabaxi
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Regular arrows have grown boring for me. I
want something with a bit more spark, a bit more
excitement. I’ve heard that arrows fletched from the spines
of a devil ignite upon impact. That should satisfy my
malaise for now.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Vegepygmy Chief
Request: Vegepygmy Frill
Requester Name: Shava Siannodel
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest, Swamp
Description: “I serve a little nearby town as healer, but I’m
running dangerously low on supplies. I’ll take anything you
can offer, and I’ll even pay for it out of my own pocket.
Vegepygmy frills would be good; I like to turn it into a paste
to treat a child in town with a bad case of asthma. Please
get some for me, won’t you?”
Reward: 3 gp

CR 3

Target: Ankylosaurus
Request: Ankylosaurus Skull

Reward: 72 gp

Target: Basilisk
Request: Basilisk Tooth (small pouch)
Requester Name: Aukan Steadyhand Kolae-Gileana
Race: Goliath
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “I have a new stoneworking project in the
works, but the tools I have available are not of a high
enough standard to get the job done. If I want to do this
project justice, I need basilisk teeth; only tools made from
them can give me the precision I need.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Bearded Devil
Request: Beard Poison (vial)
Requester Name: Irina Desilav
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “There is a man that I must kill, a cleric of a
dark god. My problem is that whenever I slice him open, he
simply heals the damage and runs away. I have heard
however of a fiendish poison that is capable of preventing
such magical healing. If I had it, I could finally end my
target once and for all.”
Reward: 60 gp

Target: Bugbear Chief
Request: Bugbear Hide
Requester Name: Korth
Race: Lizardfolk
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “More furs are needed in home. Home also
has many bugbears around. Solution seems obvious.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Cave Fisher
Request: Cave Fisher Filament
Requester Name: Birgit Conchobar
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I always say that half of a soldier’s
effectiveness is in their gear, so I always make a point of
sourcing the best gear for our troops. Cave fisher filament
is significantly tougher than hemp, much easier to carry,
and wont fray nearly as badly. We will take any that you can
spare.”
Reward: 30 gp

Target: Choldrith
Request: Choldrith Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Riskel Firestrider
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “It must have taken the drow significant effort
to make a race that is even uglier and more hate-filled than
themselves, and yet, they somehow achieved that with the
choldrith. The blood of these mutants also carry the
enzymes necessary for brewing drow poison, something I
find quite fitting. How about we use the blood of their
creations to wreak havoc on the drow themselves?”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Deep Scion
Request: Mark of the Depths
Requester Name: Delnis Ahlorsath
Race: Triton
Suggested Locations: Coast
Description: “Although I’d hate to admit it, the deep scions
I’ve encountered are a pretty powerful bunch. In particular
are their shrieks which can stun just about everything
around them underwater. I would like to keep something
like that around, if only as just a last resort.”
Reward: 70 gp

Target: Displacer Beast
Request: Displacer Beast
Requester Name: Nekane
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “A certain client has asked for something to
aid their…night-time activities. To that end, I am in need of a
displacer beast hide so I may fashion something for them. I
am willing to pay a premium to anyone able to provide one
and be discreet about it.”
Reward: 300 gp

Target: Doppelganger
Request: Doppelganger Face
Requester Name: Ivellios Calculon
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “As a master thespian and veteran of the
stage, I have thrust myself into countless roles and
characters. However, I want to delve deeper into my craft
and physically embody someone in ways that makeup
cannot provide. A doppelganger face has the ability to
change someone’s face to that of another person. Such a
thing would be a devilish test of my chameleon-like acting
talents.”
Reward: 90 gp

Target: Flail Snail
Request: Flail Snail Shell
Requester Name: Kathra Eversharp
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “Every year for our anniversary, my wife gets
me the most thoughtful presents: a fancy new hammer,
jewelled armour, a dragon skin bag; I almost hate her for it.
Well for our 100th anniversary, I’m going to get her
something she’s wanted since she was little: the shell of a
flail snail. I know it’s expensive, but she never stops talking
about all the things she’d craft if she had one. So, I don’t
care how much I’m paying for it, I’m going to make sure
that this is the best darn anniversary ever.”
Reward: 7,500 gp

Target: Githyanki Warrior
Request: Githyanki Brain
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I am fascinated by the case of the githyanki.
A race of people with psionic abilities, their brains are
unlike any other humanoids. I would very much like to
study them and perhaps find a way to grant the rest of us
similar powers.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Green Hag
Request: Hag Eyeball
Requester Name: Shanairra Liadon
Race: Elf

Reward: 75 gp

Target: Grell
Request: Grell Hide
Requester Name: Darastrix
Race: Lizardfolk
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “There is a creature in caves that is good at
moving in caves. Darastrix wants that creature’s skin, so
Darastrix can also move good in caves.”
Reward: 60 gp

Target: Hell Hound
Request: Hell Hound Fur
Requester Name: Ovak
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Okay imagine this: I stride forward into
battle, muscles gleaming, armour shining, and a big flaming
axe in my hands. I mean that literally, I want my axe to be
on fire. Some guy in a tavern told me that hell hounds have
fur that can set your weapon AND hands on fire. Get me
some of that.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Hobgoblin Captain
Request: Hobgoblin War Braid
Requester Name: Evendur Dundragon
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “The hobgoblins in this are a bit more
focused and organised than the average wandering party,
which is a nightmare for an overworked town guard (me).
They must have a captain leading them. I’ll pay a bounty if
you can track them down and bring back the proof.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Hooked Horror
Request: Hooked Horror Exoskeleton
Requester Name: Warryn Murnig
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I have some Deep Gnome cousins that are in
the market for some new building materials (they’re a little
tired of staring at stone-grey walls all day). I’ve heard that
hooked horror exoskeletons are nice if you can get your
hands on them, maybe I can send some of them their way.”
Reward: 6 gp

Target: Leucrota
Request: Leucrota Bile (vial)
Requester Name: Birgit Conchobar
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Despite my best efforts, sometimes you just
can’t have a steady supply line to your soldiers. In cases like
these, it really helps if your soldiers can live off the land,
which means having a bit of a…varied diet. If I could make
some potions of digestion and make that part of a soldiers’
standard kit, it would really help survivability in the long
term and help our soldiers stay stronger for longer. All I
need is some leucrota bile; I’ll take any that you can spare.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Manticore
Request: Manticore Teeth (small pouch)
Requester Name: Ront
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland, Mountain
Description: “I run a dinky little roadside shop, selling
trinkets and baubles to travellers. The ones that sell best
are the items made from monster teeth and claws; gives
people a sense of mystery and danger? Now, despite what
people assume (me being a half-orc and all), I don’t hunt
these monsters myself. I just buy them off whatever
adventurers pass by, then make them look more “tribal”.
So, if you have anything like that, I’ll buy it for a fair price."
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Minotaur
Request: Minotaur Horn
Requester Name: Eglath Horncarver Vaimei-Laga
Race: Goliath
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I have a steady trade amongst my people,
carving horns into tools. It is good work, and one which I
am very proud, but it leaves me little time to venture
outside for myself. Tales have reached my ears about a half
man, half bull creature called a minotaur. I would very
much like an opportunity to work with such rare horns, and
I will pay for the privilege of doing so.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Mummy
Request: Mummy Bandage
Requester Name: Shava Siannodel
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Desert
Description: “The people of my village are counting on me
as healer, but I am desperately low on medical supplies. I’ll
take just about anything and pay for it out of my own pocket
if it will keep the people of the village in good health.
Mummy bandages would be of a great help, the precious
oils in them can be extracted and diluted quite a lot to
make treatments for all sorts of ailments.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Neogi
Request: Neogi Amygdala
Requester Name: Birgit Conchobar
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Desert, Mountain
Description: “The thing that every new commander fails to
grasp is the importance of troop morale; how willing are
your soldiers to charge into what may very well be their
deaths? Morale can make or break a battle, make no
mistake about that. As such, I want to make neogi
amygdalas a standard inventory item in our supply
caravans; I’ve heard that chewing on that for a while calms
a person down and gives them the steely resolve of the
uncaring neogi themselves.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Nightmare
Request: Nightmare Hoof x4
Requester Name: Despair
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “All my life they have called me demonspawn,
based solely on my looks. Well, if that’s what they think of
me, then I may as well live up to their expectations before I
leave them behind for good. I think riding a nightmare out
of town seems fitting, don’t you? All I need to summon one
is hooves of a defeated one, I can take care of the rest on
my own.”
Reward: 48 gp

Target: Orc Red Fang of Shargaas
Request: Shargaas-touched heart
Requester Name: Sillaron Orcsbane
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “As my name would suggest, I am descended
from a long line of orc hunters. It is a tradition in my family
to venture out into the world and destroy orcs wherever we
find them, taking their hearts back in triumph to our
ancestral home. I, however, have not done so well in this
regard. While I have cut through quite a few orcs, I have yet
to find any special ones; those touched by the orcish
pantheon. If I could bring a few of those home, even if they
were not from my kills, I would be able to return with no
small amount of glory.”
Reward: 8 gp

Target: Owlbear
Request: Owlbear Feathers x1 large bag
Requester Name: Penelope Evenwood
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest
Description: “I want to make a present for mommy. She
used to be an adventurer you know, so I thought I could
make a dolly for her of the monsters she used to hunt.
She’s really proud of the owlbear head we have mounted in
our living room, so maybe I could make one of that? I’ll
need some materials to make it look good, but I’ve been
saving up my pocket money so I can pay you for it!”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Quetzalcouatlus
Request: Quetzalcouatlus Beak
Requester Name: Vyth
Race: Lizardfolk

Reward: 10 gp

Target: Redcap
Request: Redcap Boots
Requester Name: Pog Miggledy
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Forest
Description: “If there’s one thing I hate about my town it’s
just how WINDY it is! The zephyrs coming down main
street are strong enough to knock over a bull, let alone a
little gnome such as myself. I need something that’ll help
me stand my ground; I’ve heard that the boots of a redcap
can do just that. Get me a pair, would you? I’d pay a good
price if it meant being able to walk down the street without
falling over.”
Reward: 14 gp

Target: Slithering Tracker
Request: Slithering Tracker Slime (vial)
Requester Name: Umbero Falone
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I am the employer of people that partake in…
night-time activities. As part of that, it would definitely
make their lives easier if they had some way of slipping
through small spaces and cracks. I know a guy that can
make a pretty sneaky potion out of the slime of a slithering
tracker, all he needs is the materials. If you bring me some,
I’ll pay you well, especially if you can be…discreet about it.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Spectator
Request: Spectator Main Eye
Requester Name: Ulfgar Strakeln
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Urban
Description: “There’s a wizard in my adventuring band
that is being a real knot in my beard. The damn boy has an
obnoxious habit of using his magic to play pranks on us:
yesterday, he turned poor Corrin into a squirrel for no
reason! I want to forge a Shield of Reflection to take him
down a notch. I’d happily pay all of my adventuring gold just
to see his face when his next spell goes flying back at him.”
Reward: 90 gp

Target: Trapper
Request: Trapper Hide
Requester Name: Umbero Falone
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Urban
Description: “I am the employer of some people that
partake in a lot of…night-time activities. I’m always looking
for ways to make sure that they stay out of trouble, and one
of the best ways is to make sure they aren’t even seen. It
would be extremely expensive for me to commission a
bunch of invisibility items (certainly much more than my
employees are worth) so I’ll have to go with some
camouflage instead. The hide of a trapper would be good,
and I’ll even pay a premium if you can get it to me…
discreetly.”
Reward: 135 gp

Target: Water Weird
Request: Mote of Water
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Cave, Coast
Description: “I’m interested in the properties of
elementals and how they can be used in changing the
nature of some of my potions. To that end, I need some
samples of them to do some research. I’d go out and find
some myself, but I’ve started a potion that needs to be on
the boil for several months and I need to keep my eye on it.
I’d happily pay a premium if you could go out and get me
what I need.”
Reward: 150 gp

Reward: 15 gp

Target: Wight
Request: Wight Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Kethra Hornraven
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest, Swamp
Description: “It may sound unconventional, but I’ve
realised that wight blood makes for a great reconnaissance
tool. Drinking one lets you see creatures even in pitch
blackness and through cover, so I want to add it to our
scouts’ kits. We’re going to need some more of course, and
wights aren’t all that easy to find, but we’ll pay a decent
price for them.”
Reward: 8 gp

Target: Yeti
Request: Yeti Tongue
Requester Name: Vimak Threadtwister Gathakanathi
Race: Goliath
Suggested Locations: Arctic, Mountain
Description: “The tongue of a yeti has deep significance
for our people. They warn us of danger and blizzards, and
we have had some of our oldest tongues for generations. I
am not asking you to go hunt the yetis that live in the
mountains, but if you find any, we will gladly buy any
tongues from you.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Yuan-ti Malison
Request: Yuan-ti Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Swamp
Description: “One of my basic services is to make a potion
for adventurers that will protect them from the various

CR 4
Target: Babau
Request: Babau Eye x2
Requester Name: Kansif
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I own a gladiatorial ring, a place where
tough folk can come to beat each other up. Problem is,
there’s this one fighter that’s been dominating the
competition lately; it’s made the shows a little boring to be
honest. What I want to do is put a handicap on him. He’s
already agreed to it, we just need something that can do it
without restraining him too hard. I think a minor curse
should help out, something to sap his strength without
making him look too weak. I’ve got a tiefling buddy that can
whip up something like that, they say they just need a
couple of eyes from some demon. Do that for me, and
you’re in for a good reward AND front row tickets.”
Reward: 30 gp

Target: Banshee
Request: Banshee Echo
Requester Name: Crassus Rezalor
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I feel that traditional music and songs have
grown stale. I’ve started experimenting with some pretty
out-there sounds, so I really just want anything you can get
me that feels different to everything else, and as far as I can
tell, no one has incorporated a banshee into their repertoire
yet.”
Reward: 20 gp

Target: Barghest
Request: Barghest Stomach Acid (vial)
Requester Name: Calienta Ostoroth
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “There is a man that I need to destroy; a bad
man that has done bad things. His crimes against my
family and I…well…they do not bear repeating. I do not seek
something to help me kill him, I can already handle that
part myself. What I need is something to destroy him. I
need to ensure that when he is dead, he stays dead; to
ensure that after I drive my knife through his black heart,
his spiteful soul does not rise from the corpse to continue
its sins. As evil as my request may be, I need the stomach
acid of a barghest. Pouring that on his corpse will destroy
him body and soul, and finally pay my family’s debt.”
Reward: 90 gp

Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “Here’s what my dear ‘pa used to say: ‘you
don’t need to work a shovel if you know how to pour a vial.’
That’s because his tool of choice was concentrated acid to
eat through layers of stone and dirt like they were made of
sugar. The best source of it comes from oozes, they’re
plentiful, potent, and if you leave it long enough it starts to
reproduce itself. That said, I’ll take any samples you have,
I’ve always got more projects than I have materials for.”
Reward: 30 gp

Target: Bone Naga
Request: Naga Bone
Requester Name: Five Timber of the Distant Rain clan
Race: Tabaxi
Suggested Locations: Cave, Swamp
Description: “While trekking through the far jungles, I was
offered a tea by a local hermit. When I drank it, I
experienced visions and histories that few living can attest
to. When I woke, the hermit was gone, but I yearned for
that feeling again. It has taken me a few years to figure it
out, but I believe what I had was a tea brewed from the
bones of a naga. I will pay a good price if you can bring me
some, so I may feel the weight of history meld with my
mind once again.”
Reward: 30 gp

Target: Chuul
Request: Arcana Ganglia
Requester Name: Helja Loderr
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Coast
Description: “The wizard in our adventuring party died
recently (damn fool forgot to check if the chest was a
mimic). So, until we get a new one, we’re going to need
something else to find magical items and treasure when we
go dungeon delving. We’d get it ourselves, but we’re a little
busy with funeral arrangements for our wizard (or what’s
left of him anyway).”
Reward: 150 gp

Target: Couatl
Request: Couatl Feather (large bag)
Requester Name: Gordan Darkbag
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Insomnia runs in my family, it’s sorta how we
got our name. It’s been years since I’ve been able to get a
good night’s rest and frankly, I’m at my wits end. I’ll do just
about anything to get some sleep, even if it means ordering
the death of an innocent creature such as the couatl.”
Reward: 180 gp

Target: Ettin
Request: Ettin Head x2
Requester Name: Kuori Mooncarver Thuliaga & Kiori
Suncarver Thuliaga
Race: Goliath(s)
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland, Mountain
Description: “We are twins, with a bond stronger than
anyone can understand. But we have heard of a property
offered by an ettin head; an ability to share feelings and link
to another person telepathically. As strong as we are
together right now, imagine the power we will have when
linked like this.”
Reward: 240 gp

Target: Flameskull
Request: Flameskull Ashes (small pouch)
Requester Name: Anders Dagon
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Urban
Description: “I’m at the end of my apprenticeship but I’m
lacking a spell or two to complete my spellbook. I was
procrastinating a little before and ended up looking up
magical inks and stumbled upon flameskull ashes. If I can
get some, I should be able to just fill in the gaps of my
spellbook with some old spells that a flameskull had
before, which would allow me to pass my apprenticeship!”
Reward: 30 gp

Target: Ghost
Request: Ectoplasmic Trail (vial)
Requester Name: Alston Turen
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Let’s be honest, of all the dangerous issues
in the world, the undead are probably the most pressing.
That is why I try to study them whenever I can, to learn
them and their weaknesses, and hopefully, a way to defeat
them. To that end, I need study samples; a ghost’s
ectoplasmic trail should be a good start.”
Reward: 22 gp

Target: Girallon
Request: Girallon Foot x2
Requester Name: Umbero Falone
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Forest, Urban
Description: “I employ a number of people who partake in
some…night-time activities. During these…night-time
activities, they usually have to do a lot of climbing, so much
so that they tend to joke they’re half monkey. Well that got
me thinking, what if I could actually make them half
monkey it would certainly make their jobs a lot easier. I
found an artificer that can make a pair of boots to do just
that, they say they just need some girallon feet to do it.”
Reward: 30 gp

Target: Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu
Request: Gnoll Tooth (small pouch)
Requester Name: Evendur Dundragon
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “This is pretty simple. We got too many gnolls
around here, and we’ll pay just about anyone to get rid of
them. Bring back any sort of proof of their death, and you’ll
get a bounty.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Helmed Horror
Request: Helmed Horror Essence
Requester Name: Anders Dagon
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Okay I need some serious help. Through no
fault of my own, the animated armour that guards my
master’s bedchambers has been destroyed. I need to
replace it somehow, but I haven’t learned that level of
transmutation magic yet. If I can get some helmed horror
essence however, I may be able to remake the armour
without knowing the necessary spells.”
Reward: 90 gp

Target: Hobgoblin Devastator
Request: Hobgoblin Ear
Requester Name: Evendur Dundragon
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “It’s a tale as old as time: too many
hobgoblins in our area, overworked city guard asks
adventurers to go hunt down aforementioned hobgoblins.
Adventurers bring back proof, get a bounty. The end.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Lamia
Request: Lamia Claw x2
Requester Name: Criella
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Desert
Description: “I enjoy stories of the lamia, the way they
draw in their prey using their charms and appearance. I’ve
even heard that their claws can be made into weapons that
mimic some of their abilities. Not that I want to use this
weapon to kill people of course, I just want it to…teach a
few lessons.”
Reward: 45 gp

Target: Lizardfolk King/Queen
Request: Lizardfolk Teeth (small pouch)
Requester Name: Throden
Race: Lizardfolk
Suggested Locations: Coast, Swamp
Description: “Long ago, tribe cast Throden out. Throden
hate other lizardfolk, will do anything to make them hurt.
Throden is old and cannot hunt anymore, but Throden has
coin. Adventurers will be paid bounty for hunting other
lizardfolk.”
Reward: 5 sp

Target: Neogi Master
Request: Neogi Amygdala
Requester Name: Birgit Conchobar
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Desert, Mountain
Description: “The thing that every new commander fails to
grasp is the importance of troop morale; how willing are
your soldiers to charge into what may very well be their
deaths? Morale can make or break a battle, make no
mistake about that. As such, I want to make neogi
amygdalas a standard inventory item in our supply
caravans; I’ve heard that chewing on that for a while calms
a person down and gives them the steely resolve of the
uncaring neogi themselves.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Orc Blade of Ilneval
Request: Ilneval-touched heart
Requester Name: Sillaron Orcsbane
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “As my name would suggest, I am descended
from a long line of orc hunters. It is a tradition in my family
to venture out into the world and destroy orcs wherever we
find them, taking their hearts back in triumph to our
ancestral home. I, however, have not done so well in this
regard. While I have cut through quite a few orcs, I have yet
to find any special ones; those touched by the orcish
pantheon. If I could bring a few of those home, even if they
were not from my kills, I would be able to return with no
small amount of glory.”
Reward: 8 gp

Target: Orc War Chief
Request: Orc Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Malark Buckman
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’ve made a huge mistake. I was at the tavern
last week with the lads, tipping back a few pints of ale. To
be honest, the night’s a little hazy, but apparently in the
middle of it all I had challenged the biggest grognard in
town to a duel. Now I’m not much of a fighting man myself,
so I will most definitely die in that duel without some
outside help. Unfortunately, I’m also a bit strapped for cash,
so the only thing I can think of that I can also afford is
some orc blood. One sip of that stuff can turn any man into
a raging fighting machine…at least for a little while.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Shadow Demon
Request: Demonic Imprint
Requester Name: Gideon Radovan
Race: Scourge Aasimar
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I was raised to destroy demons, devils, and
fiends wherever I find them. It is my purpose in life and it is
what pushes me forward. I have found however, that I still
need more power to achieve this goal. A thought has struck
me, why not use the power of the demons themselves
against them? With the right enchantments, a captured
essence of shadow demon can be used to destroy the
forces of evil: a fitting punishment for them, no?”
Reward: 240 gp

Target: Yeth Hound
Request: Yeth Hound Voice Box
Requester Name: Cockaby Pilwicken
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’m generally a pretty peaceful person, even
if the people that keep raiding my farm are not. What I
need is something that can repel intruders without
harming them. Some tinker told me they could make some
magical fear-inducing whatchamajigger if I just bring them
a yeth hound voice box. It sounds like a good idea, but I
wouldn’t know the first thing about getting the voice box; do
you think you could help me out?”
Reward: 45 gp

Target: Yuan-ti Nightmare Speaker
Request: Yuan-ti Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Swamp
Description: “One of my basic services is to make a potion
for adventurers that will protect them from the various
poisons out there in the world. Unfortunately, I’ve gotten so
many orders recently that I’m having trouble keeping up
with demand. While there are a lot of different bases that
can be used to craft the potion, one of the more common
ones is yuan-ti blood. If you get me some, I’ll gladly pay you
a decent price for it.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Stegosaurus
Request: Stegosaurus Ridge
Requester Name: Vyth
Race: Lizardfolk
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland
Description: “Vyth is a master of crafting with bone and
claw. Vyth has heard of large lizards and wants to make
weapons from them. Get these for him, and Vyth shall pay
you well.”
Reward: 20 gp

Target: Succubus/Incubus
Request: Sucubus/Incubus Tail
Requester Name: Makaria
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I have gotten tired of the usual methods for
keeping prisoners in line. The constant whipping and
manacles take their toll on their health and on my time. I’ve
been thinking of getting a succubus tail to make a chain of
command. With that, I can keep my prisoners in line with
just a single lash a day. It’s the much more humane (and
time-efficient) method.”
Reward: 60 gp

Target: Wereboar
Request: Lycanthrope Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Shevarra Dyenina
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Lycanthropy is a terrible affliction; and those
who are cursed by it should be cared for, not cast out. I run
a home that any lycan is free to come to and stay while they
turn their lives around. To help them, I brew up copious
amounts of moon muzzle mixture, but supply is always
limited since the blood required to make it must be
donated by an already deceased lycan. If you are ever
forced to kill one, please bring me their blood so that their
death may help save the life of another.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Weretiger
Request: Lycanthrope Blood (vial)

CR 5
Target: Air Elemental
Request: Mote of Air
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Mountain
Description: “I’m interested in the properties of
elementals and how they can be used in changing the
nature of some of my potions. To that end, I need some
samples of them to do some research. I’d go out and find
some myself, but I’ve started a potion that needs to be on
the boil for several months and I need to keep my eye on it.
I’d happily pay a premium if you could go out and get me
what I need.”
Reward: 150 gp

Target: Banderhobb
Request: Banderhobb Goo (vial)
Requester Name: Fildo Hogcollar
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Forest, Swamp
Description: “I’ve got a great idea, just hear me out: giant
frog fights. Yes, I know it sounds dangerous, but that’s the
point! I already have the frogs; I just need something to
make them big. Unfortunately, I don’t know magic myself,
but I have heard that hags can make giant frogs called
banderhobbs. Get me some of whatever makes them so
big, and I’ll cut you a sweet deal of the profits.”
Reward: 40 gp

Target: Barbed Devil
Request: Barbed Hide
Requester Name: Uthal Steadyhand Katho-Olavi
Race: Goliath
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I am going hunting soon for a giant
constrictor snake and want to take some precautions. I
found inspiration seeing a porcupine defend itself and think
that the hide of a barbed devil will make an appropriate
defence if that snake tries to hug me too tight.”
Reward: 45 gp

Target: Barlgura
Request: Barlgura Fang
Requester Name: Kallista Nolioski
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’m doing some research into the practices
of cults in the local area and I’ve heard that some of them
employ demon fangs in their ceremonial duties. In
particular, they’ve been using the fang of a barlgura as a
sacrificial dagger. Ghastly stuff to be certain, but in order to
understand them better, I feel I need to have and hold one
myself.”
Reward: 6 gp

Target: Brontosaurus
Request: Brontosaurus Toe
Requester Name: Vyth
Race: Lizardfolk
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland
Description: “Vyth is a master of crafting with bone and
claw. Vyth has heard of large lizards and wants to make
weapons from them. Get these for him, and Vyth shall pay
you well.”
Reward: 45 gp

Target: Bulette
Request: Bulette Teeth (small pouch)
Requester Name: [Anonymous]
Race: Goliath
Suggested Locations: Cave, Desert, Grassland, Mountain
Description: “In my tribe, hunting a bulette is a rite of
passage. Our warriors are meant to craft their weapons
from this hunt and return to the tribe with pride, but I just…
can’t. I’m just not strong enough to hunt one, but I can’t
return without those teeth. I know asking for help is
dishonourable, but I just don’t know what else to do.”
Reward: 17 gp

Target: Cambion
Request: Cambion Sulfur (small pouch)
Requester Name: Akmenos
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “For years I’ve researched the difference
between my people and true fiends, trying to find a clear
distinction as a means of staving off the ignorant jests that
would lump us together. I believe that cambions however
pose a good reference point due to their mixed heritage; I
just need some samples of them to study.”
Reward: 10 gp

Target: Catoblepas
Request: Catoblepas Fur (large pouch)
Requester Name: Birgit Conchobar
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Swamp
Description: “An army lives and dies on its stomach. With
this in mind, there is nothing we could do to aid our
soldiers more than to make sure that their food and water
supplies last as long as possible. The fur of a catoblepas is
capable of salvaging even the dirtiest and most rancid of
liquids. It may be disgusting, but adding this to our mess
kits can mean the difference between starvation and
victory while our army is on the march.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Drow Elite Warrior
Request: Drow Blood
Requester Name: Riskel Firestrider
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “At long last we’ve discovered the secret to
the drow’s deadly poison: their own blood. It must be a sign
from providence for us, to be able to kill drow and then use
their own blood against them as a weapon. Bring me their
blood and I will happily pay a handsome bounty.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Earth Elemental
Request: Mote of Earth
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid

Reward: 150 gp

Target: Mezzoloth
Request: Yugoloth Heart
Requester Name: Borivik Helder
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “In several ways, yugoloths are worse than
regular fiends. While fiends fight merely for their
bloodthirstiness or their vanity, yugoloths do so purely out
of greed. I have made it my goal to end them once and for
all, and to do that, I will need access to Gehenna. If you can
get me yugoloth hearts, I can craft them into gems that will
take my companions and I into that dark realm, to confront
the legendary yugoloth general and destroy him.”
Reward: 1,125 gp

Target: Mindwitness
Request: Mindwitness Main Eye
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “The influence that illithids have over other
creatures is fascinating to me. Even the infamous beholder
is no match for their corruption, with their ubiquitous main
eyes mutating into mere extensions of their brains (and an
elder brain’s will). I want to study these eyes to discover the
psionic potential inside, maybe it will help me understand
the psionics of the illithids themselves better in the
process.”
Reward: 105 gp

Target: Night Hag
Request: Hag Eyeball
Requester Name: Shanairra Liadon
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Forest, Swamp
Description: “The threat posed by hags has gone on for far
too long. I am studying a way to put an end to their vile race
once and for all, and I believe that the key lies in their
infamous eyes. With the way they are connected to them, I
believe they may be used as a method to find, hunt, and
destroy them easily. I will need more samples to
experiment with first though.”
Reward: 75 gp

Target: Fire Elemental
Request: Mote of Fire
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Desert, Mountain
Description: “I’m interested in the properties of

what I need.”
Reward: 150 gp

Target: Flesh Golem
Request: Manual Ashes (small pouch)
Requester Name: Jarrod Gerkirk
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I have a few orders for animated
contraptions and trinkets. I could do it with an intricate
series of gears and mechanisms, but I’d rather take a
shortcut here and just use the same animating force that
goes into golems. Find some manual ashes from golems
and bring them back, I’ll give you a decent price for them.”
Reward: 210 gp

Target: Gorgon
Request: Gorgon Plate
Requester Name: Darrak Fireforge
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Mountain
Description: “I’m pretty damn screwed. My sister’s got a
great project practically finished and ready to show the
elders, meanwhile I haven’t even started. I’m going to need
something good and fast in order to catch up, so I was
thinking of making something out of gorgon plate. After all,
most of the work is done already when it comes to making
armour from it, the hard part is just getting some.”
Reward: 45 gp

Target: Half-Dragon
Request: Half-Dragon Scales
Requester Name: Myastan Mishann
Race: Dragonborn
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “To me, the existence of the Half-Dragons are
a mockery of our noble heritage as dragonborn. I would
wish to see them eradicated and would pay a bounty to
anyone that can provide for me proof of their deaths.”
Reward: 90 gp

Target: Hill Giant
Request: Hill Giant Fingernail
Requester Name: Sutha
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland, Mountain
Description: “I was weak once, and it cost me something
very dear. I swore that I would never be weak again, even if
I had to resort to outside sources to achieve that. The
fingernails of giants are a potent source of magical energy
that can be brewed into strength-enhancing potions. I will
take any that you have and make their strength my own.”
Reward: 45 gp

Target: Otyugh
Request: Otyugh Bile (vial)
Requester Name: Shava Siannodel
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Urban
Description: “Despite its horrid smell and taste, otyugh
bile is a wonderful remedy for all sorts of digestive
ailments. With my supplies running so low, I’d be happy to
get my hands on any sort of medical supplies, even if they
are rather unpleasant to use.”
Reward: 8 gp

Target: Red Slaad
Request: Slaad Slime (vial)
Requester Name: Rhogar of the Fenkenkabradon clan
Race: Dragonborn
Suggested Locations: Cave, Swamp
Description: “Although it is a relatively rare occurrence,
being infested with a slaad egg is a horrible affliction that I
would not wish on anyone. The problem is that some of our
warriors can engage in a fight with a slaad and not realise
they’ve been infected until it is far too late. To remedy this, I
want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do
this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely.
Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to
protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can
make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens
that kill eggs as soon as they’re implanted.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Revenant
Request: Imprint of Vengeance
Requester Name: Morthos
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Revenants are pitiful creatures. Born of pure
vengeance, their emotions can persist even after their
bodies are destroyed. I want to find a better way to help
them find peace than to indulge their bloodlust, but to do
that, I need to find out what really makes them function.
Samples of their essence in spirit paper would be a good
place to start.”
Reward: 25 gp

Target: Roper
Request: Roper Saliva (vial)
Requester Name: Lilli Tarkelby
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “Unbeknownst to many of my customers, the
foul-smelling roper saliva is actually a key component in
many of my best-selling perfumes. In fact, the perfumes sell
so well that I’ve run low on saliva. If you have any, I’ll gladly
take if off your hands, and even pay a premium if you can
remain discreet about it.”
Reward: 8 gp

Target: Sahuagin Baron
Request: Sahuagin Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Wolyn Pumanath
Race: Triton
Suggested Locations: Aquatic
Description: “Sahuagin raids have become particularly
nasty as of late, and we’re going to need to step up our
arsenal if we have a chance of beating them back. We have
ideas for new poisons or deterrents we could make to fend
them off, but we’ll need to test them first. If you can bring
back some sahuagin blood, we would be in your debt.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Salamander
Request: Salamander Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Orsik Holderhek
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Desert, Mountain
Description: “Salamander blood is a pretty staple material
to have in any high-end blacksmith, but I’ve had so many
orders lately that I’m starting to run out. I’d gladly buy any
that you have, and at a premium too due to the urgency.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Shambling Mound
Request: Root-stem
Requester Name: Shava Siannodel
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland, Swamp
Description: “I serve as the healer for a nearby town, but
my supplies have run dangerously low. One thing that I
have been looking to get for quite a while is a root-stem
from a shambling mound; when turned into a paste, they
are capable of reversing even the most egregious of
injuries. Would you mind getting me one for my emergency
kit?”
Reward: 165 gp

Target: Spawn of Kyuss
Request: Spawn of Kyuss brain
Requester Name: Morthos
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest, Swamp, Urban
Description: “Infestation by a spawn of Kyuss is one of the
worst fates imaginable, and something I would not wish on
even the direst of sinners. With that in mind, I am working
on a trinket that may be able to protect innocent people
from this fate, but I need to do more study into the spawn
of Kyuss first. If you can bring me samples of their brain for
research, you would be contributing greatly to this noble
cause.”
Reward: 240 gp

Target: Swarm of Cranium Rats
Request: Cranium Rat Brain
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave, Urban
Description: “Of all the illithid experiments out there, the
brain of a cranium rat is the one I am most excited to study.
Most of my samples of illithid experiments come from
humanoids like grimlocks and duergar, so you can imagine
how interesting it is to see illithid influence on the simple
brain of a beast. The way their feral instincts interacts with
psionic control is fascinating, and I simply cannot have
enough samples. If you can bring them back in one piece, I
will gladly pay you for each brain you can find.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Tanarukk
Request: Tanarukk Horn
Requester Name: Tarak
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “As a child, I was scorned in my tribe. It made
sense though; they considered me a half-breed and
unworthy of sharing in the tribe’s success. I suffered many
abuses during that time and left as soon as I could. I have
become a stronger person without them, and now I think
it’s time for a little closure. I want to challenge the clan
elder for leadership of the tribe, but by our custom, I first
need a weapon crafted from a tanarukk horn. Only then
will I have the right to call a duel with him and get a little
bit of payback.”
Reward: 40 gp

Target: Tlincalli
Request: Tlincalli leg
Requester Name: Khemet Hekaib
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Desert
Description: “What many people don’t appreciate is just
how useful tlincalli legs are for tools in a desert lifestyle.
They don’t break down from exposure to sand, hold up well
in the heat, and are hardy enough to be dropped from even
the highest canyons. You can make just about anything
from them if you try hard enough, which is why I can never
get enough of them. If you kill some tlincalli out there
(which by itself you should be getting paid for to be honest),
bring me their legs and I’ll give you a good price.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Triceratops
Request: Triceratops Skull
Requester Name: Vyth
Race: Lizardfolk
Suggested Locations: Grassland
Description: “Vyth is a master of crafting with bone and
claw. Vyth has heard of large lizards and wants to make
weapons from them. Get these for him, and Vyth shall pay
you well.”
Reward: 120 gp

Target: Troll
Request: Troll Flesh
Requester Name: Wellby Tosscobble
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest, Grassland, Mountain
Description: “Even among the gourmand community, troll
flesh is considered quite the strange meal. I believe it
mostly comes down to the taste which is best described
as…acquired. I can taste a good undertone in it however
and I am sure that if I experiment with it enough, I can
figure out a recipe that can bring out is full flavour
potential.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Umber Hulk
Request: Umber Hulk Guts
Requester Name: Dimble Beren
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “There’s a new dye I’m developing that has
umber hulk guts as a major component. The end result is a
smoky grey colour that seems to shift with the light and has
become quite popular among my more high-end clients. So
popular in fact that I’ve run out of guts. I need someone to
do an emergency supply run for me, and I’ll shell out some
decent coin for anyone that does.”
Reward: 8 gp

Target: Unicorn
Request: Unicorn Hoof
Requester Name: Shava Siannodel
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Forest, Grassland
Description: “I serve the local village as healer, but I’m
desperately low on supplies. I need anything you can spare,
from the basic to the valuable. Although I’m a fan of
unicorns, I wouldn’t mind having some of their hooves to

Reward: 60 gp

Target: Vampire Spawn
Request: Vampire Spawn Heart
Requester Name: Morthos
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Vampire spawn generally don’t deserve their
fates, having been enslaved by darker forces than them.
Although their deaths are a tragedy, they can be used to
save others. Bring me their hearts and I can craft it into an
instrument for detecting the vampire that enslaved them,
and hopefully help in bringing down the foul creature.”
Reward: 150 gp

Target: Water Elemental
Request: Mote of Water
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Cave, Coast
Description: “I’m interested in the properties of
elementals and how they can be used in changing the
nature of some of my potions. To that end, I need some
samples of them to do some research. I’d go out and find
some myself, but I’ve started a potion that needs to be on
the boil for several months and I need to keep my eye on it.
I’d happily pay a premium if you could go out and get me
what I need.”
Reward: 150 gp

Target: Werebear
Request: Lycanthrope Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Shevarra Dyenina
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Lycanthropy is a terrible affliction; and those
who are cursed by it should be cared for, not cast out. I run
a home that any lycan is free to come to and stay while they
turn their lives around. To help them, I brew up copious
amounts of moon muzzle mixture, but supply is always
limited since the blood required to make it must be
donated by an already deceased lycan. If you are ever
forced to kill one, please bring me their blood so that their
death may help save the life of another.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Wood Woad
Request: Wood Woad Seed
Requester Name: Morris Gleazleby
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Forest
Description: “I have spent the better part of a decade
growing the greatest garden in the land (or at least my
servants have). The soaring trees and bountiful flowers are
beautiful enough to attract starry-eyed visitors…and jealous
vandals. I need something to protect my work, and
thankfully, I overheard a passing adventurer speak of a
wood woad in the nearby forest that I’m sure wouldn’t mind
‘donating’ his seed to place a protective enchantment over
my garden. It’s for the greater good, I assure you.”
Reward: 375 gp

Target: Wraith
Request: Wraith Energy
Requester Name: Lawrence Ichelm
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Wraith energy is something that I haven’t
experimented with yet. It possesses very strong
necromantic energy and I feel there’s great potential to
make something…interesting. I’m going to need someone to
go out and get the energy for me first of course, I can’t take
the time to leave my lair, I mean, house.”
Reward: 130 gp

Target: Xorn
Request: Xorn Eye x3
Requester Name: Alberich Deepdelver
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “As proud as I am of the dwarven race for
their treasure finding abilities, there’s no denying that the
xorn have us beat on that front hands down. That said,
there’s no stopping me from getting my hands on their eyes
and making their talents my own.”
Reward: 90 gp

Target: Young Remorhaz
Request: Remorhaz Antenna x2
Requester Name: Cedric Kunsgnos
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Arctic
Description: “My enemies are everywhere; I just know it. I
can’t prove that they have ways of getting through my alarm
spells and traps, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. What I
want is a more organic approach to security, the antennae
of a remorhaz should do. Those things will let me know if
anything is scurrying about trying to get me in my sleep.”
Reward: 75 gp

Target: Yuan-ti Pit Master
Request: Yuan-ti Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Swamp
Description: “One of my basic services is to make a potion
for adventurers that will protect them from the various
poisons out there in the world. Unfortunately, I’ve gotten so
many orders recently that I’m having trouble keeping up
with demand. While there are a lot of different bases that
can be used to craft the potion, one of the more common
ones is yuan-ti blood. If you get me some, I’ll gladly pay you
a decent price for it.”
Reward: 3 gp

Target: Cyclops
Request: Cyclops Heart
Requester Name: Krusk Giantsbane
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “You wouldn’t be able to tell now, but in his
prime years, my father was the greatest giant hunter in our
clan. He could break a giant’s neck with one swing of his
mighty fist and send them scurrying with his terrible roar.
He doesn’t have long left to live now though, and I want to
give him something to remind him of his glory days. I’d go
get it myself, but I can’t leave his bedside for a moment.”
Reward: 40 gp

Target: Drider
Request: Drider Oil (vial)
Requester Name: Artin Rummanheim
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “The men and me are going venturing deep
underground soon on a scouting mission. We’ve heard
rumours that some drow have set up close by and want to
keep an eye out. Of course, where there’s drow, there’s
spiders; and where there’s spiders, there’s webs. Some
drider oil ought to keep us safe in the worst parts of it
though, so I’d like to stock up before we head out.”
Reward: 6 gp

Target: Galeb-Duhr
Request: Galeb-Duhr Core
Requester Name: Riardon Dalanthan
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “I’m in need of a new guardian over a fey
circle I have identified nearby. As far as I am concerned, I
could do no better than creating a galeb-duhr for the job. If
you happen upon a core, sell it to me so I can restore it and
use it for a new duty.”
Reward: 173 gp

CR 6

Target: Annis Hag
Request: Hag Eyeball
Requester Name: Shanairra Liadon
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Forest, Swamp
Description: “The threat posed by hags has gone on for far
too long. I am studying a way to put an end to their vile race
once and for all, and I believe that the key lies in their
infamous eyes. With the way they are connected to them, I
believe they may be used as a method to find, hunt, and
destroy them easily. I will need more samples to
experiment with first though.”
Reward: 75 gp

Target: Bodak
Request: Bodak Eye x2
Requester Name: Theodoric Evantur
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Cave, Swamp
Description: “As a judge, it is my duty to determine the
guilt of the criminals that come before me and sentence
them accordingly. Of course, even with magic this can be
difficult; some criminals are crafty enough to talk their way
through a zone of truth spell. I want something a bit
stronger, something powered by…something stronger. The
eyes of a bodak can see into one’s soul and find the
darkness that lives there. If I had those, I would be able to
judge a man without a doubt, and justice would always be
served.”
Reward: 200 gp

Target: Chasme
Request: Chasme Proboscis
Requester Name: Kallista Nolioski
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’m doing some research into the cults of my
local area and have heard that they use the proboscis of a
chasme in their ceremonies. Specifically, they use them to
drain a victim of their blood so they may use it later in their
fiendish rituals. I want to have a sample of a proboscis for
my research, to better understand the cults and their
motives.”
Reward: 60 gp

Target: Chimera
Request: Chimera Goat Head, Chimera Lion Head, and a
Chimera Dragon Head
Requester Name: Westra Greycastle
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Mountain
Description: “I was an adventurer in my youth. Had a good
run of slaying monsters and saving (very appreciative)
princesses. One of the first monsters that I killed was a
chimera, but in my excitement, I had neglected to take a
trophy. My slaying days may be far behind me, but I would
love for a small reminder of them, and finally getting that
trophy would fill me with no small amount of satisfaction.”
Reward: 325 gp

Target: Gauth
Request: Gauth Main Eye
Requester Name: Nybarg Swifthand
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: Cave, Urban
Description: “I’m a bounty hunter by trade. I enjoy it quite
a bit, but problem is that I’m having trouble bringing my
targets in alive. It’s not because I brutalise them or
anything, it’s just that they always run, and it’s hard enough
to aim at a moving target, let alone aim for anything non-
vital. If I get something that can help me slow them down
or stop them completely then I’d gladly pay for that. The
bonus I’d get in live bounty rewards would easily make up
for what I pay.”
Reward: 173 gp

Target: Githzerai Zerth
Request: Githzerai Brain
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I am fascinated by the case of the githzerai.
A race of people with psionic abilities, their brains are
unlike any other humanoids. I would very much like to
study them and perhaps find a way to grant the rest of us
similar powers.”
Reward: 15 gp

Target: Hobgoblin Warlord
Request: Hobgoblin War Braid
Requester Name: Evendur Dundragon
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “The hobgoblins in this are a bit more
focused and organised than the average wandering party,
which is a nightmare for an overworked town guard (me).
They must have a warlord leading them. I’ll pay a bounty if
you can track them down and bring back the proof.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Invisible Stalker
Request: Mote of Air
Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling

Reward: 150 gp

Target: Kuo-toa Archpriest
Request: Kuo-Toa Archpriest Brain
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Coast
Description: “The kuo-toa are another fascinating result of
illithid experimentation. Their brains are so chaotic yet so
powerful. I want some samples to study, perhaps I can
figure out how they work and add some method to their
madness.”
Reward: 2 gp

Target: Medusa
Request: Medusa Heart
Requester Name: Makaria
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “That damn Rieta will not stop making fun of
me for the size of my nose, that is when she’s not staring at
herself in the mirror. Well, if she wants to gaze at her own
reflection all day, I’ll give her a little magical help. A
medusa heart should cut it, and by “it” I mean her ego.”
Reward:75 gp

Target: Mouth of Grolantor
Request: Hill Giant Fingernail
Requester Name: Sutha
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest, Grassland, Mountain
Description: “I was weak once, and it cost me something
very dear. I swore that I would never be weak again, even if
I had to resort to outside sources to achieve that. The
fingernails of giants are a potent source of magical energy
that can be brewed into strength-enhancing potions. I will
take any that you have and make their strength my own.”
Reward: 45 gp

Target: Vrock
Request: Vrock Vocal Cords
Requester Name: Quarion Candlebrook
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I have a marvellous idea for a prank on my
house guests, I’m going to set a demonic music box on a
timer under their bed to play while they sleep. No doubt
they’ll find it to be the most whimsical joke of the season,
but I’ll need some vrock vocal cords to craft the box in the
first place.”
Reward: 60 gp

Target: Wyvern
Request: Wyvern Poison (vial)
Requester Name: Umbero Falone
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Mountain
Description: “Wyvern poison is the standard poison
among our thieves and assassins and so we never have
quite enough of it. Get some for us and be discreet about it,
and you’ll find a fat pouch of coin in your future.”
Reward: 900 gp

Target: Young Dragon
Request: Young Dragon Scales
Requester Name: Feng
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “There is an armour that I covet, one made
from the scales of a dragon. I have searched and hunted for
a dragon strong enough to give me the type of armour I
want for years but to no avail. Although I would prefer to
get the scales myself, I am not above paying someone else,
should they come into their possession.”
Reward: 2,500 gp

Target: Grick Alpha
Request: Grick Pearl
Requester Name: Dimble Raulnor
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “There’s a pearl I’ve been hunting down for a
while now. It only grows in the stomachs of long-lived
gricks, but it has a unique lustre that can’t be matched by
anything else. For too long that shelf in my jeweller’s store
has been bare, I will pay a good premium to anyone able to
help me fill it.”
Reward: 280 gp

Target: Korred
Request: Korred Scalp
Requester Name: Lorilla Nackle
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest, Grassland, Mountain
Description: “I’ve been commissioned by a wealthy patron
with a big purse. She wants something elegant to wear, but
she’s also got a paranoid side, so she wants it to be a
functional set of armour as well (I guess in case she gets
attacked at one of her fancy balls). Anyway, the only way I
see this working is if I can find “threads” of metal, and the
only way I can figure out how to do that is by using the
hairs of a korred. I’ll need a lot of it, so if you can bring me
any uncut korred scalps you find, I’ll pay you well for it.”
Reward: 250 gp

Target: Mind Flayer
Request: Mind Flayer Mucus (vial)
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “There is so much to learn from the elusive
illithids, but I will endeavour to start small in studying
them. Their mucus contains enzymes from the brains they
consume, and so it displays certain qualities that are
fascinating to a researcher like me. Bring me back some of
these samples and there will no doubt be more work for
you in the future.”
Reward: 15 gp

CR 7

Target: Bheur Hag
Request: Hag Eyeball

Reward: 75 gp

Target: Blue Slaad
Request: Slaad Slime (vial)
Requester Name: Rhogar of the Fenkenkabradon clan
Race: Dragonborn
Suggested Locations: Cave, Swamp
Description: “Although it is a relatively rare occurrence,
being infested with a slaad egg is a horrible affliction that I
would not wish on anyone. The problem is that some of our
warriors can engage in a fight with a slaad and not realise
they’ve been infected until it is far too late. To remedy this, I
want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do
this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely.
Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to
protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can
make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens
that kill eggs as soon as they’re implanted.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Draegloth
Request: Draegloth Claw
Requester Name: Xanaris Aleaneal
Race: Elf (Drow)
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I do not have any shame in saying this: I
have been exiled from my home. The reason I am so calm
about this, is because I know that soon I will have my
revenge. I was exiled for a crime that I did not commit, and
I fully intend on destroying those that were complicit in my
downfall. But of course, revenge is nothing without a little
theatrics, and in my culture, sending a draegloth claw to
one’s enemies is a grave sign of warning. I have admittedly
had some trouble in finding a draegloth however, so if you
can find one for me and cut off one of its claws for me, I
will pay you fairly for the trouble.”
Reward: 17 gp

Target: Drow Mage
Request: Drow Heart
Requester Name: Riskel Firestrider
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “The highest members of drow society are
known to have blessings of Lolth that they carry in their
hearts. The best thing is, these hearts can be used by
anyone once removed from their bodies. What better way
to eradicate the drow, than to use their goddess and the
organs of their fallen comrades against them?”
Reward: 45 gp

Target: Oni
Request: Oni Heart
Requester Name: Engong
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: Cave, Forest, Mountain
Description: “The heart of an oni possesses powerful dark
magic in it; magic that can grant strength to any that wield
it. I only need such power for a little while, to enact a much-
delayed justice. After that, I swear I will put the heart away
and never use it again.”
Reward: 750 gp

Target: Shield Guardian
Request: Shield Guardian Breastplate
Requester Name: Giasces Clario
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “As a merchant that has found himself quickly
moving up in the world, I am in sore need of extra
protection. I was thinking of investing in a good solid shield
guardian, but it is next to impossible to find a golem-crafter
with an open commission spot. Instead, I’ll have to turn to
the next best thing: a mercenary outfitted with the armour
of the guardian. If you manage to destroy someone else’s
shield guardian, make sure to bring me its breastplate so I
can outfit my bodyguard with what they need to protect my
life.”
Reward: 75 gp

Request: Serpent Touched Heart
Requester Name: Jhank

Jhank can be stronger.”

CR 8

Target: Chain Devil
Request: Chain Devil Eye x2
Requester Name: Quarion Candlebrook
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I have a masquerade party coming up soon

Imagine the shrieks of terror (and fun) from the other
guests!”
Reward: 300 gp

Target: Cloaker
Request: Cloaker Hide
Requester Name: Nekane

Description: “A certain client has asked for something to

Reward: 45 gp

Target: Fomorian
Request: Fomorian Eye
Requester Name: Quorian Candlebrook
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “I have thought of the best prank ever. There’s
a lady in my circle of friends who is OBSSESSED with her
looks. She spends hours every day in front of the mirror,
preening and primping. I want to use a fomorian eye to
curse her for a little bit with the deformed features they’re
famous for. It’s only temporary of course, and I’m sure she’ll
laugh about it after.”
Reward: 375 gp

Request: Glabrezu Pincer
Requester Name: Eberk Steelfist
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I’ve started working with a particular sample
of iron that can only be forged in extremely high
temperatures. Unfortunately, such flames also end up
melting my tools, so I first need to make some tools that
can stand the heat. Glabrezu pincers should do pretty well,
they’re probably the most economical option, at least.”

Request: Hazrou Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Throkk
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I have received a bounty to hunt down a
criminal who I believe has fled into the sewers of the city.
I’d rather not spend half my time down there puking my
guts out, so I’m going to need something to bolster my
constitution a bit. I have an alchemist friend who says they
can brew something like that for me, they just need a vial of
hezrou blood.”
Reward: 25 gp

Target: Hydra
Request: Hydra Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Shava Siannodel
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I am running low on alchemy supplies,
which causes me to worry about the wellbeing of the town
that I tend to as healer. If I could get any medicinal
supplies, I would happily pay out of my own savings for
them. Hydra blood is extremely potent and doesn’t even
need to be brewed into a full healing potion for it to act as
medicine. Having some of that would make a big difference
in my ability to help the town.”
Reward: 10 gp

Target: Shoosuva
Request: Shoosuva Fur (small pouch)
Requester Name: Fildo Hogcollar
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “So there’s this underground fighting pit
nearby, and to be honest, I really don’t like them. Now don’t
get me wrong, I enjoy seeing a good fight as much as the
next guy, but these aren’t exactly what you would call “good
fights.” Most of them are pitting a full-grown man against
some starved and scared wolf that wouldn’t be able to put
up a good fight if its life depended on it…which
unfortunately it does. There’s not really much I can do to
save them from their terrible fates, but what I can do is
make sure they get a little justice for themselves before
they face them. I want to keep a little shoosuva fur on me
when I go watch the fights, a whiff of that will turn even the
most timid animals into a rabid monster that’ll tear the
throat out of the next jerk that steps into the ring with them
(and if I happen to make a little money betting on the
underdog, then where’s the harm in that?)”
Reward: 50 gp

Target: Spirit Naga
Request: Naga Bone
Requester Name: Five Timber of the Distant Rain clan
Race: Tabaxi
Suggested Locations: Cave, Swamp
Description: “While trekking through the far jungles, I was
offered a tea by a local hermit. When I drank it, I
experienced visions and histories that few living can attest
to. When I woke, the hermit was gone, but I yearned for
that feeling again. It has taken me a few years to figure it
out, but I believe what I had was a tea brewed from the
bones of a naga. I will pay a good price if you can bring me
some, so I may feel the weight of history meld with my
mind once again.”

Description: “I am doing research into the cults in my

is to get a sample of it myself.”
Reward: 225 gp

Target: Clay Golem
Request: Manual Ashes (small pouch)
Requester Name: Jarrod Gerkirk
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I have a few orders for animated
contraptions and trinkets. I could do it with an intricate

Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to
protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can
make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens
that kill eggs as soon as they’re implanted.”
Reward: 1 gp

Target: Nycaloth
Request: Yugoloth Heart
Requester Name: Borivik Helder
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “In several ways, yugoloths are worse than
regular fiends. While fiends fight merely for their
bloodthirstiness or their vanity, yugoloths do so purely out
of greed. I have made it my goal to end them once and for
all, and to do that, I will need access to Gehenna. If you can
get me yugoloth hearts, I can craft them into gems that will
take my companions and I into that dark realm, to confront
the legendary yugoloth general and destroy him.”
Reward: 1,125 gp

Target: Treant
Request: Treant Breastplate
Requester Name: Enna Raethran
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Forest
Description: “The death of a treant is not one to be treated
lightly. They are innocent creatures, dedicated only in
protecting the forests that I have also sworn my life to. If
they do fall however, they would want their remains to be
used in the best way possible, and as far as I am concerned,
the best way is to craft armour from them so other
protectors may take their place. If you do bring me some of
their bark, I will reward you and not ask how exactly you
got it.”
Reward: 225 gp

Target: Ulitharid
Request: Mind Flayer Mucus (vial)
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “There is so much to learn from the elusive
illithids, but I will endeavour to start small in studying
them. Their mucus contains enzymes from the brains they
consume, and so it displays certain qualities that are
fascinating to a researcher like me. Bring me back some of
these samples and there will no doubt be more work for
you in the future.”
Reward: 30 gp

CR 10

Target: Aboleth
Request: Aboleth Teeth (large bag)
Requester Name: Shandri Tallmast
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Coast
Description: “Years ago in my sailor days, I was caught in a
storm, yet I found myself unharmed on the shore the next
morning. But since then I believe I have been marked by
whatever slimy denizen called that ocean its domain. If I
want to be free from whatever it did, I believe I need a
totem, crafted from a set of its teeth. Maybe then I will be
free from the nightmares have plagued me since that
night.”
Reward: 30 gp

Target: Alhoon
Request: Alhoon Brain
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “Illithids have so much to teach us; or at least
their brains do. I want to unlock the mysteries of their
psionic abilities, and alhoon brains are of particular note to
me. I want to study what makes them so different to
regular illithids, and perhaps isolate something that can be
used on ourselves to increase our own mental powers. All I
need is a sample to study, which I will pay handsomely for.”
Reward: 2,400 gp

Target: Death Kiss
Request: Death Kiss Main Eye
Requester Name: Nadarr Drachedandion
Race: Dragonborn
Suggested Locations: Cave, Urban
Description: “We are plagued by a mysterious problem as
of late, an invisible hunter that stalks through our territory,
killing our herds and poaching our game. The task of
tracking this hunter falls to me, but I will admit that they
have vexed me so far. I have an idea though. A few years
ago, I had met a man with a crimson monocle that allowed
them to see blood as if it were a shining beacon. They
claimed they had it crafted from the eye of a death kiss. If I
had such a tool, I would be able to hunt this hunter without
a problem.”
Reward: 810 gp

Target: Death Slaad
Request: Slaad Slime (vial)
Requester Name: Rhogar of the Fenkenkabradon clan
Race: Dragonborn
Suggested Locations: Cave, Swamp
Description: “Although it is a relatively rare occurrence,
being infested with a slaad egg is a horrible affliction that I
would not wish on anyone. The problem is that some of our
warriors can engage in a fight with a slaad and not realise
they’ve been infected until it is far too late. To remedy this, I
want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do
this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely.
Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to
protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can
make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens
that kill eggs as soon as they’re implanted.”

Description: “My wife is dying. I know not what kind of
dark presence grips her, but even the most powerful of
healers have failed to help. In my desperation, I can think
of only one cure: the blood of an angel. I know that I face
punishment from the divine for even asking for such a
thing, but it is a price I am willing to pay if it means giving
her even one more day.”

Target: Froghemoth
Request: Froghemoth Tongue
Requester Name: Cadman Everglade
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Forest, Swamp
Description: “As a gallant adventurer, I must have only the
finest equipment. That includes something to stop me from
(hypothetically) dropping my sword in the mud when a
massive oaf of an orc smacks it with his axe. I’ve heard that
some crafty tinkers out there have figured out how to
transform the tongue of a froghemoth into a weapon chain
that can make your weapon an extension of your own hand.
I would get it myself of course, but I’m too busy right now
with more important quests.”
Reward: 750 gp

Target: Guardian Naga
Request: Naga Bone
Requester Name: Five Timber of the Distant Rain clan
Race: Tabaxi
Suggested Locations: Cave, Swamp
Description: “While trekking through the far jungles, I was
offered a tea by a local hermit. When I drank it, I
experienced visions and histories that few living can attest
to. When I woke, the hermit was gone, but I yearned for
that feeling again. It has taken me a few years to figure it
out, but I believe what I had was a tea brewed from the
bones of a naga. I will pay a good price if you can bring me
some, so I may feel the weight of history meld with my
mind once again.”
Reward: 30 gp

Target: Stone Giant Dreamwalker
Request: Stone Giant Fingernail
Requester Name: Sutha
Race: Half-Orc
Suggested Locations: Cave, Mountain
Description: “I was weak once, and it cost me something
very dear. I swore that I would never be weak again, even if
I had to resort to outside sources to achieve that. The

take any that you have and make their strength my own.”
Reward: 200 gp

Request: Manual Ashes (small pouch)
Requester Name: Jarrod Gerkirk
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I have a few orders for animated
contraptions and trinkets. I could do it with an intricate

goes into golems. Find some manual ashes from golems
and bring them back, I’ll give you a decent price for them.”

Target: Yochlol
Request: Demon Pearl
Requester Name: Dimble Raulnor
Race: Gnome
Suggested Locations: General

Race: Human

Description: “My wedding anniversary is coming up in a
few weeks and somehow, my wife has gotten it into her
head that I’m buying her a dragon-scale dress as a present.
I can tell you right now that I cannot afford that. What I can
afford however is a behir-scale dress; all I need are the
scales. It’s not like she’s going to be able to tell the
difference, right?”

Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “There’s a certain kick that I want in my
potions that can only get from the elemental energies of a
defeated genie. I’d go out and find some myself, but I’ve
started a potion that needs to be on the boil for several

Requester Name: Five Timber of the Distant Rain clan
Race: Tabaxi
Suggested Locations: Desert
Description: “I have travelled the world in search of
stories, and who knows more stories than the ancient
sphinxes. Guardians of long-forgotten history, every fibre of

would gladly pay a large reward for anyone that can bring
me such a tantalising item.”

Requester Name: Caramip Aleslosh
Race: Gnome

Description: “I’ve been hitting the bottle pretty hard lately
and it’s starting to become a bit of a problem. I’ve been
thinking of using some form of medication to help calm me
down whenever I get the shakes. I heard that horned devil
blood works pretty well as a calmative, if I could get some
of that I think it would do me a world of good.”

Target: Arcanaloth
Request: Yugoloth Heart
Requester Name: Borivik Helder
Race: Human

Description: “I am doing some research into the cults of
my local area and have heard of some of the curses they

Target: Morkoth
Request: Morkoth Eye x2
Requester Name: Therai
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Coast
Description: “Some people use morkoth eyes for their
hypnotic quality; not me though. I know a little ritual you
can do with them to bring out their ability to find and
scavenge things. Just say a few choice words over them,
and suddenly you can spot the most valuable items in the
biggest piles of junk as if there was a massive beacon
coming out of them. Anyway, I’m going on a big scavenging
run soon and I want it to be as efficient as possible, so if
you got any morkoth eyes lying around I’ll be happy to buy
them off you.”

Requester Name: Cedric Kunsgnos
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Arctic
Description: “My enemies are everywhere; I just know it. I
can’t prove that they have ways of getting through my alarm
spells and traps, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. What I
want is a more organic approach to security, the antennae

Requester Name: Wellby Tosscoblle
Race: Halfling
Suggested Locations: Mountain

Description: “As a judge, it is my duty to determine the
guilt of the criminals that come before me and sentence
them accordingly. Of course, even with magic this can be
difficult; Some criminals are crafty enough to talk their way
through a zone of truth spell. I want something a bit
stronger, something powered by…something stronger. A ki-
rin is one of the wisest creatures to ever roam the world.
Although their deaths are always a tragedy, if you hand
their heart over to me, I can use it to enact justice and
perhaps balance the scales a little.”

Requester Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling

Description: “One of my basic services is to make a potion
for adventurers that will protect them from the various

many orders recently that I’m having trouble keeping up

Suggested Locations: Cave, Swamp
Description: “All my life, they have called me a monster. All
my life, people have feared me based solely on my looks.

the rest.”
Reward: 45 gp

Target: Neothelid
Request: Neothelid Brain
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “As a scholar of illithids and psionics, the
brain of a neothelid has the potential to change everything I
have researched so far. Because the neothelid comes from
a tadpole that has had no influence from other minds, it
provides the perfect control experiment and baseline for
understanding illithids. With these, I’ll be able to
understand exactly how a humanoid’s brain contributes to
the psionic potential of the mind flayers, and thus figure out
how to unlock some of that in our own minds.”

Requester Name: Yuldra Stayanoga
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: Desert, Urban
Description: “For half my life, people have come to
challenge me to magical duels, hoping that they will be the
one to finally topple one of the greatest arch-mages that
ever lived. Although I’ve managed to beat back every single
one of them, the years have caught up to me and
unfortunately, I must admit that I am not the duellist I used
to be. That hasn’t stopped the constant flow of eager
upstarts though, so I need some extra protection to put us
on an even playing ground. A rakshasa hide would be good,
since it will allow me to effectively ignore anyone without
the power to give me a real challenge and let me focus on
fending off the people with actual talent.”

Request: Vampire Blood (vial)
Requester Name: Morthos
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Vampires are some of the most insidious
creatures I have come across, not least of which is because
of their ability to turn innocent people into bloodthirsty

those they have enslaved, so if you manage to slay one,
please do not waste their blood. Give it to me so that I can
try to save a few lost souls.”

Description: “There is an armour that I covet, one made
from the scales of a dragon. I have searched and hunted for

Tyrant Eye and will pay copious amounts of gold and jewels
to anyone able to bring me one. Also contrary to all the

Request: Elder Brain Thalamus
Requester Name: Barakas
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: Cave
Description: “I am a scholar of psionic abilities, and in this
entire field, there is no more valuable specimen than an
elder brain. Every living inch of them contains psionic
secrets that the rest of us have yet to even scratch the
surface of, but I intend to discover them all. If I had to
spend my funding on any particular part of the elder brain,
I would like to start with its thalamus; if it is anything like
the thalamus of a humanoid, it should be a key lobe of the
elder brain and thus be rich in answers and research
possibilities.”

down, hiding in a fort with his cronies. I know I have the
strength to defeat them all, I just need a way to bash down
the gates of that fort. I have heard of a magical dust that
can enchant my hammer to do just that. I know it is
expensive, but for my father’s peace, I will pay any price.”
Reward: 20,000 gp

CR 18
Target: Demilich
Request: Bone Dust (small pouch)
Requester Name: Lawrence Ichelm
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I am in the market for something to give my
spells a little extra kick, and I have found out that the bone
dust of a lich or demilich may be the thing that I need. How
I found that out is nobody’s concern, it’s not like I myself
am a lich or anything. Look, just get me the bone dust.”
Reward: 1,200 gp

CR 19
Target: Balor
Request: Balor Ash (3 small pouches)
Requester Name: Gunnloda Lutgehr
Race: Dwarf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “Me and the boys have been doing some
serious mining these days and hit a bit of a snag.
Specifically, an abyssal rock that we just can’t get through
even with our strongest picks. So, I was thinking, if it’s an
abyssal rock, why not use some abyssal explosives? Balor
ash mixed with saltpetre should do the trick.”
Reward: 2,250 gp

CR 20
Target: Pit Fiend
Request: Pit Fiend Head
Requester Name: Thia Xiloscient
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I was visiting my good friend Hamund the
other day and had the chance to look at his collection of
taxidermy creatures. While there were many impressive
specimens, the one that I have fixated on was the mounted
head of a pit fiend. I cannot stop thinking about its fierce
countenance and terrifying visage and I have decided that I
shall have one of my own. Now, I am not much of a hunter
myself, but I do have gold. Fetch me what I desire, and you
shall be handsomely rewarded.”
Reward: 24,000 gp

CR 21

CR 23

Target: Empyrean
Request: Empyrean Heart
Requester Name: Leucis
Race: Tiefling
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “An empyrean heart is by far one of the most
valuable organs in existence. A force of nature in and of
itself, it is coveted by many clients of mine. Find me one
(and don’t ask any further questions), and you will be paid
handsomely.”
Reward: 30,000 gp

Target: Kraken
Request: Kraken Heart x3
Requester Name: Anastrianna Galanodel
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: Coast
Description: “There is no denying the evidence anymore,
the waves will soon consume our coastal city and our
leaders are too busy lining their pockets to do something
about it. Therefore, the task of saving our home falls to me.
I have studied far and gathered many resources and found
the solution: the hearts of a kraken. When used properly,
they can be transformed into magical crystals that keep the
tide at bay. I have everything else I need, the only thing
remaining is the hearts themselves.”
Reward: 54,000 gp

Target: Ancient Dragon
Request: Dragon Heart
Requester Name: Torinn Delmirev
Race: Dragonborn
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “One of the sacred treasures of our clan has
always been the dragon crystal that sits at the center of our
village. A recent disaster has swept through the town
however and the crystal has been horribly damaged. I
believe that it can be fixed however, using the energies
given off by a fresh dragon heart from an ancient dragon.
Undertake this dangerous quest for us, and the village
coffers shall be yours.”
Reward: 39,000 gp

Target: Lich
Request: Bone Dust (small pouch)
Requester Name: Lawrence Ichelm
Race: Human
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “I am in the market for something to give my
spells a little extra kick, and I have found out that the bone
dust of a lich or demilich may be the thing that I need. How
I found that out is nobody’s concern, it’s not like I myself
am a lich or anything. Look, just get me the bone dust.”
Reward: 4,500 gp

Target: Solar
Request: Solar Blood x1 vial
Requester Name: Drusilia Holimion
Race: Elf
Suggested Locations: General
Description: “My wife is dying. I know not what kind of
dark presence grips her, but even the most powerful of
healers have failed to help. In my desperation, I can think
of only one cure: the blood of an angel. I know that I face
punishment from the divine for even asking for such a
thing, but it is a price I am willing to pay if it means giving
her even one more day.”
Reward: 1,200 gp

FAQs

Q: Why didn't you include the meat you can harvest from creatures?
A: I wanted to avoid relatively generic harvesting materials. Largely I assumed that DM's would be able to judge meat
harvesting by themselves without any need for a guide.

Q: Can I give suggestions or feedback?
A: Of course! This is a living document and I fully endorse anyone to send in item suggestions or balance feedback. See the
Contact Us section for contact details.

Q: Can I change an item to suit my campaign?
A: Feel free to do so. Items were designed to be setting agnostic and able to fit into anything, but edge cases could always
occur. I encourage DMs to use this guide as a launching point for their own ideas.

Q: Will you be making a follow-up for Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes?
A: Yes I am. Follow @drifterworkshop on Twitter for regular updates.

Q: How do your rules fit in with the newly released Artificer class on Unearthed Arcana?
A: To be honest, they do not. The updated Artificer class was released very late into the development of this guide and as such,
this guide does not incoporate them at all. A future update may attempt to reconcile them.

Q: Why don't you include the beast section?
A: I felt that beasts were too mundane to include in the harvest table, and largely could be replaced by a DM googling an actual
butcher table.

Q: How come you didn't include any loot like weapons and armour?
A: Those items are largely context sensitive. After all, not every Hobgoblin walks around with a spear at all times, so I felt best
to leave those out and up to the DM to decide based on context.
